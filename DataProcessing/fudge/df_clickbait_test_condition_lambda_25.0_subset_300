Security Council called to review what the Trump administration calls its most dire national security concern. “The more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it.”', 'Tillerson’s push at a special session of the Security Council came as the Trump administration said it is willing to bargain directly with North Korea over ending its nuclear weapons program, but under strict conditions that make talks unlikely anytime soon.', 'Ahead of the diplomatic effort at the United Nations, President Trump said direct conflict is possible. “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an interview this week. “We’d love to solve things diplomatically, but it’s very difficult.”', 'Hours after the U.N. meeting, North Korea fired another missile early Saturday local time, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Cmdr.

The launch underscored North Korea’s determination to show its defiance of international pressure.', 'Trump took to Twitter to reiterate his expectation that Chinese President Xi Jinping will use his leverage to make North Korea stop its weapons activities.', '“North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” Trump tweeted.', 'In the most-detailed explanation to date of the Trump administration’s emerging policy for dealing with North Korea, Tillerson told the Security Council on Friday that U.S. urgency is driven by the current nuclear threat to allies South Korea and Japan as well as the likelihood that North Korea will soon be able to strike the United States.', '“All options for responding to future provocation must remain on the table. Diplomatic and financial levers of power will be backed up by a willingness to counteract North Korean aggression with military action if necessary,” Tillerson said.', '“We much prefer a negotiated solution to this problem,” he added. “But we are committed to defending ourselves and our allies against North Korean aggression.”', 'The effect of both Trump’s and Tillerson’s remarks is to present a willingness to negotiate with North Korea that surprised and pleased diplomats the United States needs for any new joint effort at the United Nations or elsewhere.

Security Council session Friday comes at a particularly tense time in relations between North Korea and the United States, with the Trump administration sending warships to the region in a show of force against Kim’s regime.', 'This week, North Korea conducted large-scale artillery drills, showing off conventional weaponry that can easily reach South Korea’s capital, Seoul, the center of a metropolitan region of about 25\xa0million people.', 'A North Korean propaganda outlet released a video clip Thursday showing a simulated attack on the White House and declaring that the ability to destroy the United States “is in our sights.”', '“North Korea must understand that respect will never follow recklessness,” Tillerson said Friday. “North Korea must take concrete steps to reduce the threat that its illegal weapons programs pose to the United States and our allies before we can consider talks.”', 'The last round of direct talks, initiated in 2003 and involving the United States, China and other nations, produced no rollback of the North Korean program.

"‘Wonder Woman,’ ‘Spider-Man’ and How Trailers Push the Familiar "," All photographs courtesy of Paramount Pictures... betterment a. modest, but steady step-grandchildren now","['The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.', 'At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.', 'Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.', 'Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.', 'The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.', 'The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.', 'Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.', 'Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.', 'In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.', 'Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”', 'That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.', 'As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.', 'Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.', 'If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.', 'Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.', 'One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.', 'There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I.']",0.66666666664

The French, on the other hand, enjoy nothing less than a high-minded, lofty debate over abstract concepts – or so it is believed. The British ask: “It works in theory, but does it work in practice?” The French ask: “It works in practice, but does it work in theory?” So the joke goes.', 'As a London-based French citizen watching my own country heading for a rancourous presidential runoff on 7 May and Britain preparing for its first post-Brexit general election, I’m not sure the supposed differences between us are as marked as we like to think. And I see lessons for the UK from what is happening across the Channel.', 'While you struggle to make sense of Brexit, we’re struggling with the looming catastrophe that would be the election of Marine Le Pen. And up against her in the second round, the 39-year-old centrist reformer, Emmanuel Macron, is our new national sensation. He wants to abolish the once watertight left-right divide, upending decades of ideological confrontation.', 'He’s no Robespierre. He quoted Albert Camus in one of his rallies earlier this month: “Each generation no doubt believes it is doomed to remake the world. The task of our generation may be even larger: it consists in preventing the world from coming undone.” So, not entirely unBritish.', 'This is not a perfect parallel. Though withdrawal from the EU is sad and costly, it’s unlikely to unravel British democracy. By contrast, the victory of a far-right leader in France would be the death of all the values the republic is meant to uphold. Brexit may be troublesome for EU citizens living in the UK – and there have even been several xenophobic attacks since 23 June – but a Le Pen win would put 7 million or so French nationals of African, Arabic or Muslim descent under constant physical threat. The bigotry that pervades her rallies would be unleashed nationwide. The country’s fragile social fabric, which terrorism has already torn at, would be ripped apart entirely.', 'If the polls are right, Macron should win. He hasn’t yet. But if his rise has proved something the British might do well to heed, it is that a robust political centre does have a chance against rightwing populism. The centre is not ineffective, and it’s not outdated. The old structures may crumble – and indeed the traditional postwar parties in France are all but wiped out – but that does not mean the extreme parts of the political spectrum will be the only ones to grow out of the ruins.', 'Radical rightwing politics has thrived by exploiting the popular rage that characterises the mood in France today (fuelled by joblessness and deep distrust of the elites). Nearly 50% of the electorate voted on 23 April for either the far left, the far right, or Trotskyist and maverick candidates. But so far, even against that sorry backdrop, a clearsighted, energetic Macron has come out on top.', 'He calls himself “progressive”, and stands for social liberalism, or pro-market social democracy. He’s not anti-capitalist nor anti-globalisation, and certainly not nativist. He’s the anti-radical who advocates step-by-step, moderate reform to heal the many fractures of an extremely tense and anxious country. He doesn’t want to pitch social classes or ethnic groups against one another. His is a slow-motion revolution, and that’s something utterly new by French standards. Indeed, he’s more interested in what works in practice than in what might look good in theory. That may seem familiar to you Brits.', 'It’s an approach that could strike a chord across a continent that sees nationalism reawakened, along with its ghosts. Le Pen embodies that rising nationalism in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, the Jarosław Kascyński crowd in Poland. Brexit can be interpreted as a kind of nationalist resurgence. Witness Theresa May’s observation this week that 27 European countries are “lining up against” Britain. How often has a siege mentality tactic been deployed by illiberal politicians to galvanise the populists, with no regard for the consequences?', 'Macron’s ascendency could encourage those in Britain who would like to see another path open up. One that would help counter the kind of narrative deployed by May; one that could soften Brexit. A left-leaning Labour offers little solace in that regard. The best antidote seems to be a confident centre, one built on pragmatic, moral, optimistic beliefs, and, as we see in France, rich in potential. If Macron prevails on 7 May, the immediate effect of his centre revolution will probably be felt in France. But its most important effect should be to galvanise like minds abroad, and certainly here.']",0.199999999979999

In this scenario, the team could take a much surer prospect at No. 1 such as Garrett and give him the big payday that comes with that honor. The Tar Heels QB would still be on the roster for the 2017 campaign, but at a vastly reduced price tag. The No. 12 draft pick this year will earn approximately $13.8M, with an $8.2 signing bonus making up the majority of that deal.

(Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)', ""Immigrant investors spent over $1.4 billion in 2012 on California development projects, ranging from mixed used real estate to small infrastructure. No state has more EB-5 visa recipients than California. Yet, in February, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein said that wasn't good enough. American needed to open its doors to others instead. She was quoted by NBC news saying EB-5 was selling U.S. citizenship while millions wait in line for visas. EB-5 is a tiny portion of the U.S. immigration total."", ""The most powerful legislator on this issue, though, is Grassley. He also wants to see the program gutted. He is giving the industry a starting position of roughly $1.2 million as a minimum investment. The regional centers hate this proposal, saying it would turn off thousands of investors and stop projects currently on paper. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service has proposed regulations for even higher minimums, now at $1.3 million. EB-5 will eventually be changed to fit these new guidelines. Friday's extension gives Grassley more time to negotiate with the industry. His former staffer, Kathy Nuebel-Kovarik, is a policy director now at USCIS, giving Grassley's proposals an upper hand."", ""But Grassley's rule changes, assuming they ultimately bring the minimum up to a more palpable $800 million as the market expects, are not a deal breaker."", 'Some of the proposals include setting aside visas for projects for infrastructure, distressed assets in non-target zones, and rural development. Chinese investors have tended to pump money into mixed used real estate in cities where they want to live. But investments into rural infrastructure, for instance, like dams and river ports, would not force those investors to live in those areas. They can live wherever the want. The problem for the developer of mixed use real estate, however, is that if more of the visas are required to focus on non-core cities and states, they will have a harder time convincing foreign buyers to move into a new Oklahoma City high rise.', 'Opponents of the visa like Feinstein point out a handful of fraud cases where small companies or individuals created real estate projects, lured immigrants on the EB-5, got their money and disappeared.', ' FBI agents inspect the offices of the California Investment Immigration Fund after serving search warrants in an investigation into an alleged $50 million high-end visa fraud scheme involving as many as 100 Chinese nationals in San Gabriel, California on April 5, 2017. The scheme allegedly involved the EB-5 visa program.

There is an emotional reaction against this program because it is an immigrant-based program, says Samar Ali, an attorney specializing in EB-5 cases at Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville.', 'Trump says he is in favor of a merit-based immigration system, while Feinstein is laser focused on refugees. If open border Democrats lumped changes to the EB-5 visa program with a broader immigration reform bill down the road, it could face its D-day once more.', ""I'm not so sure Trump meddles with it, says Roger Bernstein, an EB-5 project manager and owner of the EB-5 for Florida Regional Center. Bernstein said that the Trump family was involved in an EB-5 deal in New Jersey. Jared Kushner built the 50-story Trump Bay Street tower with Chinese investors looking for citizenship."", 'These are wealthy immigrants sending their kids to private schools and are not a drain on public services, if that is a concern, says Bernstein. But if Congress lumped EB-5 into a larger immigration reform bill that promotes amnesty for example, then for sure Trump would kill it.']",0.06666666666

Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared?', 'Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing “the Wall,” no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and his Supreme Court appointment. “Hitting it out of the ballpark,” said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts.', 'Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. “When I get up in the morning, I think, ‘Well, what did Trump do now?’” said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office.', 'And then there are those somewhere in between. Some who were reluctant in November say they are happy with a growing economy and his support for the military. Some who cast a hedged, qualified vote for Mr. Trump say they are frustrated with his temperament and repeated falsehoods and would consider supporting a primary challenger.', 'Others say: Give it more time — 100 more days, or 1,000.', 'Al Exner, Republican Party chairman of Sauk County, Wis., made no secret of his delight over Mr. Trump’s victory as he chatted in January in a diner in one of America’s most closely divided places.

Still, Mr. Exner was hard pressed to name more than a few accomplishments. He said the airstrike Mr. Trump ordered on Syria resounded as a declaration of American strength.', '“We’ve been on the back burner, defensively, since Obama took office,” he said. “The first thing I said to my wife when I heard about Syria was, ‘Syria isn’t really the target.

The Drumbeats Don’t Add Up to Imminent War With North Korea ," Over the past several days, as threatening comments between US and other North speakers and political statements from both sides have become increasingly bellicose, the opinions you've come to associate with these topics have ranged from dismissive to anxious.","['WASHINGTON — President Trump summoned all 100 members of the Senate for a briefing by his war cabinet on the mounting tensions with North Korea. An American submarine loaded with Tomahawk missiles surfaced in a port in South Korea. Gas stations in the North shut down amid rumors that the government was stockpiling fuel.', 'Americans could be forgiven for thinking that war is about to break out. But it is not.', 'The drumbeat of bellicose threats and military muscle-flexing on both sides overstates the danger of a clash between the United States and North Korea, senior Trump administration officials and experts who have followed the Korean crisis for decades said. While Mr. Trump regards the rogue government in the North as his most pressing international problem, he told the senators he was pursuing a strategy that relied heavily on using China’s economic leverage to curb its neighbor’s provocative behavior.', 'Recent American military moves — like deploying the submarine Michigan and the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the waters off the Korean Peninsula — were aimed less at preparing for a pre-emptive strike, officials said, than at discouraging the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, from conducting further nuclear or ballistic missile tests.', '“In confronting the reckless North Korean regime, it’s critical that we’re guided by a strong sense of resolve, both privately and publicly, both diplomatically and militarily,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pentagon’s top commander in the Pacific, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.', '“We want to bring Kim Jong-un to his senses,” he said, “not to his knees.”', 'There are other signs that the tensions fall short of war. Mr. Kim continues to appear in public, most recently at a pig farm last weekend. South Koreans are not flooding supermarkets to stock up on food. There is no talk of evacuating cities and no sign the United States is deploying additional forces to South Korea. Nor is the American Embassy in Seoul advising diplomats’ families to leave the country.', 'All those things happened in the spring of 1994, when President Bill Clinton was considering a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean reactor to prevent the North from extracting plutonium that it could use to make a bomb. That is the closest the United States has come to a military clash with North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.', '“The reality is not as tense as the rhetoric on both sides would lead you to believe,” said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.', 'None of this is to say there is no risk of miscalculation that could escalate into hostilities. Mr. Trump’s penchant for provocative statements introduced an element of unpredictability to a relationship in which the uncertainty has historically been on the North Korean side. How Mr. Kim reacts is the major variable in a complicated equation.', 'North Korea is also steadily adding to its nuclear arsenal and edging closer to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile, tipped with a warhead, that could hit the United States. Intelligence estimates vary on how quickly that could happen, but some say within three years: a timetable that would put a successful test within Mr. Trump’s term in office.', '“No previous president has ever been in that situation,” said Victor D. Cha, director of the Asian studies program at Georgetown University, who advised the administration of George W. Bush on North Korea. “I don’t think we’re going to war, but we’re in a different phase.”', 'Mr. Cha said he viewed the briefing for senators as part of an effort by the White House to signal the seriousness of North Korea to an American public that regards it as a distant, complicated issue. But others criticized the president for being theatrical, with some saying he was using the senators as a prop to burnish his 100-day record.', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', '“There was very little, if anything, new,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “It is still unclear what our strategy and policy is.”', 'Even some Republican senators complained afterward that they had learned little and wondered why they needed to pile into buses for the trip from Capitol Hill to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House grounds, where they were seated in an auditorium.', '“I’m not sure I would have done it,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He said he was not sure why the briefing had been timed for this week and begged off further comment, adding, “All I can say is, it was fine.”', 'White House officials said they had been responding to a request from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and that Mr. Trump had proposed moving the site of the briefing. He spoke to the senators for less than three minutes, mainly promoting his efforts to persuade President Xi Jinping of China to put more economic pressure on North Korea.', 'Mr. Trump then turned the briefing over to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr.', 'Analysts said it was too early to assess Mr. Trump’s claim that the Chinese were finally cooperating with the United States. Previous presidents believed they had made headway with Beijing, only to have China’s actions fall short of expectations.', 'The reports of closed gas stations in North Korea were intriguing, analysts said, because they suggested that the North was bracing for a suspension of fuel shipments from China. The Chinese have yet to take such a step, though they have curtailed purchases of North Korean coal.', 'In a separate briefing for reporters, the White House said Mr. Trump had decided on a strategy that would include diplomacy to persuade China to keep up pressure on its neighbor, as well as military preparations.', 'A senior White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the nature of the military preparations or the timetable for seeing a change in North Korea’s behavior. He also said the administration was considering returning North Korea to the government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.', 'On Thursday morning, the National Security Council will hold a principals committee meeting to weigh economic and military options.', 'Admiral Harris told lawmakers that North Korea’s recent setbacks in its missile launches would not slow the country’s efforts to achieve its nuclear goals.', '“With every test, Kim Jong-un moves closer to his stated goal of a pre-emptive nuclear strike capability against American cities, and he’s not afraid to fail in public,” he told the House Armed Services Committee in a hearing on security challenges in the region.', 'Admiral Harris welcomed China’s role in influencing the North, but also singled it out for criticism. “While recent actions by Beijing are encouraging and welcome, the fact remains that China is as responsible for where North Korea is today as North Korea itself,” he said.']",0.06666666666

United Takes Added Steps to Win Back Customers and Avoid More Ugly Events , The Times' Kate Agers Superfund and Pat Purdy explain which US-and-Australian airlines are going full throttle on improving their passenger treatment efforts and how they look to stop another Dao-like incident.,"['United Airlines, still trying to regain its footing more than two weeks after a video showed a police officer violently dragging a passenger off a plane, on Thursday provided its fullest account yet of the episode and announced a series of steps meant to keep such an event from happening again.', 'The measures include new limits on when passengers can be removed from planes and much greater financial incentives — up to $10,000 in travel certificates — for those who volunteer to change flights.', 'In a report detailing its findings about the April 9 episode, United apologized again for the events involving the passenger, Dr. David Dao, who sustained a concussion and a broken nose and lost two teeth, according to his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio.', 'The airline also promised to introduce several other changes to its booking and boarding procedures later this year.', 'United said that passengers who have boarded flights should never have to give up their seats, except for safety or security problems. The airline also said that it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from its planes over booking issues and that all crew members traveling to other flight assignments would be booked into seats at least an hour before departure, two changes it had announced previously.', 'United said it would also create a new automated check-in process that gives customers a chance to express their willingness to relinquish their seats in exchange for compensation. And starting on Friday, United will increase the maximum sum offered to passengers who voluntarily give up their seats to $10,000 from the $1,350 cap that most airlines use.', 'In raising the cap, United is following the lead of Delta Air Lines, which announced on April 14 that its supervisors could offer up to $9,950 in compensation to passengers who voluntarily gave up their seats. Industry officials said that compensation offers would still start at a few hundred dollars, and that payments close to the new caps were likely to be rare.', 'Security officers dragged Dr. Dao off a United plane in Chicago to make room for an airline employee trying to get to work in another city. The episode has been a public relations disaster, pushing United to undertake a broad examination of how it treats customers.', '“Our goal is to reduce incidents of involuntary denial of boarding to as close to zero as possible and become a more customer-focused airline,” the airline said in the report.', 'United also plans to reduce how much it overbooks some flights and to create a special call-center team that can come up with solutions for overbooking problems. Maggie Schmerin, a United spokeswoman, said that rather than simply trying to switch passengers onto other flights to their destinations, the airline could fly travelers to nearby airports and pay for car services to take them the rest of the way.', 'In a further bid to regain its customers’ faith, United said it would address another cause of frustration among passengers — compensation for lost baggage — that is unrelated to the episode involving Dr. Dao. According to the report, United will pay customers $1,500, no questions asked, if it loses their bags. Customers whose baggage is worth more than that can still file for additional compensation, the airline said.', 'Here is what happens when people fly more often, in fuller planes and pay higher fees.', 'The changes United is making now “are steps in the right direction,” said Douglas G. Kidd, executive director of the National Association of Airline Passengers in Vienna, Va. But, he said, “Someone could have just used their head with Dr. Dao and said, ‘If you’re a doctor, and you need to see patients the next day, let me see if we can find somebody else.’”', 'Mr. Demetrio, Dr. Dao’s lawyer, said that he and his client both thought that United’s plans represented “an excellent start in a short period of time” toward solving the problems that passengers face with many airlines. He said he hoped that expanded training for United employees would include “how to defuse the situation instead of throwing gasoline on it.”', 'The episode involving Dr. Dao has also upended United’s top leadership ranks. The company’s board decided on Friday that the chief executive, Oscar Munoz, would not ascend as planned to the role of chairman. The board is also adjusting its incentive compensation program for senior executives to make it “directly and meaningfully tied to progress in improving the customer experience.”', 'Shortly after the episode, Mr. Munoz appeared to blame Dr. Dao for causing the problems. But Mr. Munoz soon reversed himself, apologizing repeatedly to Dr. Dao and saying he felt “shame” over how the situation had been handled.', 'Mr. Munoz, in a statement released on Thursday with the report, said he realized that “actions speak louder than words.”', '“Today,” he added, “we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.”', 'United’s report includes a description of what happened in the April 9 episode, though it contains few new details.', 'United released much of the same information on Wednesday in written answers to questions from the Senate Commerce Committee.', 'Dr. Dao and dozens of other passengers had boarded a United Express flight to Louisville in the late afternoon when the airline determined that maintenance issues with another plane might keep a four-person flight crew from reaching Louisville in time for a flight they were scheduled to work the next morning, according to the airline’s report.', 'The airline said it was worried that it might have to cancel the flight out of Louisville, disrupting 100 other passengers, if the crew was not there on time. So it offered an $800 travel credit to any passengers who agreed to give up their seats on the flight leaving Chicago.', 'When no one took the offer, gate agents invoked the airline’s involuntary denial-of-boarding process. According to the report, that meant customers who had paid the lowest fares, were not connecting to other flights and had checked in the latest were at the top of the list to be removed from the plane. Whether a customer had frequent-flier status was another consideration, the report says.', 'United officials have said they followed this procedure in selecting Dr. Dao, his wife and another couple from removal from the flight. The other couple agreed to accept compensation and leave. After Dr. Dao declined to leave, United officials called police officers with the Chicago Department of Aviation to try to persuade him to go.', 'But according to passenger videos and aviation police reports released on Tuesday, Dr. Dao tried to keep the officers from pulling him out of his seat before being dragged out of it.']",0.06666666666

Department Of Education Moves To Make Student Loan Process Easier While IRS Tool Is Down," There's good news and bad news for students looking to gain a leg-up on their private- or large-flaked higher-sEducating, but you won't find the following facts about financial aid in the press.","[' Betsy DeVos, U.S. secretary of education, listens during a strategic and policy discussion with U.S. President Donald Trump, not pictured, and executives at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 11, 2017. Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg', ""Applying for financial aid isn't going to be as bad as feared this year after all. The Department of Education Department has agreed to allow colleges and universities more flexibility to use as part of their verification procedures while the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) is unavailable."", 'The DRT was shut down in March of this year after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) noticed suspicious activity related to the tool. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a Senate Finance Committee in April that taxpayer data may have been compromised. While the exact numbers of affected taxpayers have not yet been determined, Koskinen told the Committee that it could be as many as 100,000.', 'As a result, while the IRS had initially planned to shut down the tool for a few weeks, the IRS and Federal Student Aid (FSA) subsequently released a joint announcement indicating that the DRT would be offline until the start of the next FAFSA season. That has created problems for students and their families who rely on the DRT for purposes of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information on the FAFSA is used to determine financial aid for the school year. For the most recent FAFSA cycle, there were 19,757,764 total applications: approximately one-quarter of those applications were students completing FAFSA for the first time.', ""The DRT isn't the only tool that can be used to complete the FAFSA. The information needed to complete the FAFSA can be found on a previously filed tax return. To complete a 201617 and 201718 FAFSA, students should manually enter 2015 tax information from the tax return filed in 2016 (not the 2016 tax information used to file in 2017). Students who do not have a copy of the appropriate tax return can order a tax transcript directly from IRS using the Get Transcript tool at www.irs.gov/transcript, or by calling 1.800.908.9946 to order a copy."", ""Filling out the FAFSA manually can slow down the financial aid process or result in errors. To help, Lynn B. Mahaffie, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, issued a letter (downloads as a pdf) directing schools to consider a signed paper copy of the 2015 IRS tax return that was used by the tax filer for submission to the IRS as acceptable documentation to verify FAFSA/ISIR tax return information. Additionally, colleges are no longer required to collect documentation obtained from the IRS or other tax authorities verifying that their family did not file a 2015 tax return (the so-called Verification of Nonfiling). Instead, the applicant or the applicant's family can provide the school with a signed statement certifying that the individual has not filed and is not required to file a 2015 income tax return, and a listing of the sources of any 2015 income earned by the individual from work and the amount of income from each source together with a form W2, or equivalent, for each source of that income."", 'Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said about the new measures, These flexibilities are an important step toward making the process easier. They help applicants who normally would have used the IRS DRT to more easily complete the application process. She added, We will continue to look for additional ways to ease the burdens created by the IRS DRT outage until the tool can be restored with added security measures in place later this year.', 'The new flexibilities begin immediately and apply to both the 2016-17 and 2017-18 FAFSA processing and verification cycles.']",0.06666666666

CC Sabathia is on pace for 18 wins. Despite losing two of three in Pittsburgh over the weekend, the New York Yankees head into a three-game set at Fenway Park against the rival Boston Red Sox as winners of 10 of their past 13 games, jumping to No. 5 in our MLB Power Rankings.', 'So is something special brewing in the Bronx, or is it just too soon to bet on the Bombers?', ""Our All-Star panel -- Yankees beat writer Andrew Marchand, columnist Sam Miller and SweetSpot's David Schoenfield -- weighs in."", ""Andrew Marchand: Judge's history at nearly every level of professional baseball has been to struggle at first, then hold his own. The majors don't seem to be any different. He struck out 42 of 84 at-bats in 2016, but now looks fearsome. If he is a .260, 35-homer and 100-RBI guy, I think the Yankees would sign up for that. Who doesn't think that's realistic? And he might be even better than that."", 'How far will the New York Yankees go in 2017? Vote at the bottom of the page »', ""Sam Miller: With the caveat that everything is prone to exaggeration in early season stats, yes, he is. Nobody hits the ball harder than Judge -- maybe not even Giancarlo Stanton -- and the pleasant surprise has been that he's not swinging and missing very often, with a contact rate close to the league average. And he's young and spry enough to avoid being a liability on defense or the basepaths."", ""David Schoenfield: He's obviously swinging the bat well, and there's a chance he's on a fast learning curve. After striking out 44 percent of the time in his major league call-up in 2016, he's cut that down to 25 percent. If he can maintain that rate, he will do a lot of damage. At the same time, his minor league numbers were also more good than great, so I'm not ready to call him the next Dave Winfield after 60-something at-bats."", ""Marchand: Well, they don't have Gary Sanchez or Didi Gregorius, so the question might be: Could they become even better? The thing is, Ronald Torreyes has been as good as Gregorius at short, while Austin Romine has held steady behind the plate. Chase Headley might have a very good year, but right now he might be the AL MVP. It would be hard to argue that that will continue."", 'Miller: For every case of ""no way can this keep up"" -- Headley\'s .339 batting average, Aaron Hicks\' .727 slugging percentage, Jacoby Ellsbury\'s best OPS+ since 2011 -- there\'s an equally plausible reason for optimism. Greg Bird has been making contact again and just needs a few balls to fall in, and Sanchez and Gregorius will return to the lineup. In the aggregate, it could be a considerably better lineup than last year\'s well-below-average group, but the April ""breakouts"" are mostly coming from established veterans who, realistically, probably aren\'t really breaking out.', ""Schoenfield: They were leading the AL in runs per game at the start of the week and they've been doing it without Sanchez and Gregorius. Of course, the guys playing in place of them have been terrific -- Romine has an .840 OPS and Torreyes has 13 RBIs. I love the addition of Matt Holliday, who will grind out at-bats and take his walks, and there is some depth on the bench. I'm not sure I'm buying all the power just yet: Judge, Hicks and Starlin Castro have combined for 14 home runs, a pace they won't keep up. So, is this a top-three offense? Probably not, but it should be better than last year when the Yankees were 12th in the AL in runs."", 'Marchand: It depends how you define ""back."" He is nothing like the hard-throwing Cy Young Award winner, who received a 10-figure contract. However, he is a legit starter, whose smarts have transformed his career to the point that his goal to play a lot longer seems very realistic. If he is a legit No. 2 starter, the idea of a Yankees wild card has more weight.', 'Miller: In fact, he\'s probably less ""back"" than he was last year, when he was sort of back. His strikeout and walk rates are just awful -- no starter in baseball last year had a higher walk rate and a lower K rate and managed to make it to even 75 innings -- and his overall strike rate this year is his lowest since 2004. It\'s only four starts, so it\'s too early to draw conclusions, but that\'s even more true when talking about something as volatile as ERA or win-loss record.', ""Schoenfield: I'd say the upside is something similar to last year, when he finished with a 3.91 ERA. The stuff isn't there to return to his old ace-level status, his walk rate is still higher than peak Sabathia and his strikeout rate through four starts is down even from last year. He's certainly learned to nibble at the corners, but he's a pitcher living right on the edge."", ""Marchand: I usually say that over 162 games, your beliefs usually bear out. Before the season, there was a rosy outlook, where Masahiro Tanaka is a Cy Young candidate, Sabathia continues his reinvention into an Andy Pettitte-clone, while Michael Pineda and Luis Severino reach their potential. Jordan Montgomery looks like he could be a real MLB starter. So, yes, they could have a very good year, though, I'm not totally sold."", ""Miller: Pineda and Severino have combined to strike out 56 batters and walk five. Then there's the nine home runs allowed and the hard contact, but there aren't many pitchers who have combined strikeout stuff with great control who have not succeeded."", ""Schoenfield: If there's a reason for optimism for the 2017 Yankees, it's the early performances of Pineda and Severino. Sure, Pineda has done this kind of stuff before, so you never know, but strike-throwing machine Severino looks like a different pitcher."", ""Marchand: I thought the Yankees would win around 84 games. I'll stay in that range, though they have come out very strong against a weak schedule. The Rays, White Sox and Cardinals might all be last-place teams, or close to it, this year. The Yankees can only beat who is in front of them. So far -- especially at home -- they have done a fine job of it. So I think there is evidence that they will finish above .500 again, but I don't think they are a World Series contender -- yet."", ""Miller: They were a .500 team coming into the season and they've banked a couple extra wins early. That's enough to join the wild-card race."", 'Schoenfield: Hey, I picked them as a wild-card team before the season, so no reason to change my mind now -- especially with the Blue Jays stinking things up and other potential wild cards like the Mariners and Royals not looking so great either.']",0.26666666664
The 6 Biggest Credit Mistakes Millennials Are Making, Here are six credit mistakes millennials need to be wary of... andfinances,"[""Of all the financial mistakes that can come back to haunt you, the ones that impact your credit score can seem minor at the time but have lasting effects. Your credit score is only going to get more important as your financial life progresses. It comes into play when you're renting an apartment, being considered for a loan or trying to buy a house. Your credit score is meant to be a reflection of how you handle your money, and problems that arise sometimes come from not understanding how to effectively manage your money or your credit cards.  Seeing as most people aren't given a financial crash course before signing on for their first credit card or student loan, it's not surprising that young professionals can get off to a rocky start credit-wise. To help you protect your finances now and in the future, here are six credit mistakes millennials need to be wary of:"", '1. Opening store credit cards just to cash in on the rewards.', 'Financial expert Jane Hwangbo, a former portfolio manager and the founder of MissionOverMoney.com, says that while a store card may get you an initial discount and enticing future rewards, opening them tends to be damaging in the long term. She says, They usually carry nosebleed high interest rates (often higher than 20%), so that if you carry a balance instead of paying it off in full every month and make only minimum payments, you end up owing way more than the amount you paid for your purchase. Paying attention to the interest rate on your credit card is crucial. In a survey conducted by Experian, only half of the millennials asked knew what the interest rate on their card was.', '2. Not keeping track of how often your credit report is pulled.', ""The amount you (or someone else) checks your credit score impacts the score itself, and often times people are not even aware of when their score is being checked. Often if you're applying for a new credit card or housing, the issuer or landlord will pull a hard credit inquiry. Hwangbo says, One inquiry doesn't make much of a dent on your overall score, but multiple credit checks can push you into a higher-risk category for lenders, causing an increase in the interest rates you're offered when you apply for some major purchases, such as a home."", '3. Treating credit cards like cash.', ""Hwangbo: Credit cards are not cash. We can spend money on them like cash, but whatever we use is instantly new debt on our personal balance sheet. Remembering that, especially if you already have student loans outstanding, may help. Let's be honest, who needs to owe more money these days? You're putting off your financial freedom."", ""4. Using credit cards to pay for extravagances you can't afford."", ""There is definitely a divide in our perception of how credit cards should be used. The general approach to credit cards is that you should, at the very least, use them for big purchases, but some take that to mean they should use credit cards for purchases they can't actually afford. What it actually means is that while big purchases, like plane tickets or a new couch, should be put on your credit card, they should only be purchased if you have the funds to pay off the balance when it's due. Buying things you can't pay off in the very near future is an easy way to accumulate credit card debt."", 'More on Forbes: ', '5. Not opening a credit card or opening too many.', ""While millennials are known to be hesitant when it comes to credit cards (Bankrate reports that 63% of millennials don't have a credit card), a common problem amongst credit card users is that they end up with too many. Often if you're carrying credit card debt, it may be spread over more than one card. You need to be careful with how many cards you open, because closing credit cards can impact your score adversely. However, not building credit isn't good either, which is the problem with avoiding credit cards altogether. Hwangbo says, In general, the length of credit history accounts for about 15% of your overall score. And remember, you don't have to close accounts that are not in use, even with $0 balance. If you need to consolidate the number of credit card accounts you have open, I suggest fully paying off the card with the poorest payment history that you've had open for the shortest period of time. The negative history will fall off your credit report after seven years."", '6. Not understanding the nuances of when to make payments or what your credit card limit is.', ""A third of the millennials surveyed by Experian did not know the spending limit on their credit cards. Hwangbo recommends keeping your credit card balances below 30% of your available credit on any given card. This is fairly common advice, and it's impossible to follow if you don't even know what your spending limit is. Beyond that, millennials may struggle with not understanding when their payment is due, and what they should actually be paying (the statement balance, versus the entire card balance). The best course of action is to pay the credit card bill (often phrased as statement balance) in full by the end of the billing cycle.""]",0.7999999999799999

"8 Habits That Make Millennials Stressed, Anxious And Unproductive"," anxiety, whether ""in your late 20s, 30s or 40s and how you fare in work and life could bedeviling your generation.""","['According to the American Psychological Association (APA), millennials experience more stress and are less able to manage it than any other generation. More than half of us admit to having lain awake at night during the past month from stress.', 'Not surprisingly, millennials are also more anxious than older Americans. The APA reports that 12% of millennials have a diagnosed anxiety disorder almost twice the percentage of Boomers. On a non-clinical scale, a BDA Morneau Shepell white paper discovered that 30% of working millennials have general anxiety, while a 2014 American College Health Association (ACHA) assessment found that anxiety regularly afflicts 61% of college students.', ""Anxiety not only harms our wellbeing but also sabotages our productivity. The ACHA assessment found that the top two tolls on students' academic performance were stress and anxiety. Two-thirds of millennials interviewed by BDA attribute declining work performance to anxiety."", ""Sources of millennial anxiety may include a tough job market and student debt as well as psychological causes I've covered previously such as ambition addiction, career crises and choice-overload. But even our day-to-day behaviors can incite anxiety. Here are eight common habits that instigate stress and compromise our potential:"", ' Flickr/Stefan', '1. Bad sleep habits', 'Perhaps the most prevalent contributor to anxiety is poor sleep.

Common causes of insufficient sleep include going to bed at different times, not making sleep a priority and spending time on phones or laptops right before bed.', 'Instead:', 'Calm Clinic, an online magazine dedicated to anxiety management, suggests forming a long, boring nighttime routine free from technology, keeping a journal by your bed to write down thoughts that keep you awake, and exercising during the day to wear out your body.', 'The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market', ""Don't let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good."", '2. Skipping sustenance', 'Eating consistently regulates not only our metabolism and insulin levels but also our mental stability.', 'Waiting too long to eat or missing out on breakfast may lead to unsteady blood sugar levels, which can cause anxiety-like sensations, including shakiness, dizziness, confusion, and difficulty speaking, writes Body and Health. Dehydration has a similar effect. Because food and water are biological needs, anxiety naturally follows hunger and thirst.', 'Instead:', 'Eat meals regularly. Keep granola bars or nuts at your desk or in your purse. Bring a water bottle to work and sip it throughout the day. Have a glass of water right when you wake up and before you go to sleep.', ' Unsplash', '3. Drinking coffee', ""Drinking coffee makes us more alert and, in many cases, helps us perform better on short-term tasks. But it can also make people jittery, irritable and nervous, especially if they're already predisposed to anxiety. Sensitivity to caffeine is, in fact, heightened in people with panic disorder and social phobia, and caffeine can provoke panic attacks in some individuals. Caffeine is also diuretic, which can cause dehydration an anxiety trigger established above."", 'Instead:', 'Try weaning off coffee by switching to just one cup a day, decaf or black tea. If you feel calmer and more in control after a couple weeks without it, commit to quitting and pull out all the stops.', '4. Sitting', ""America's surge of anxiety symptoms parallels our increasingly sedentary lifestyles. But, until a recent review by BMC Public Health, it was unclear whether the two were actually linked. After lengthy analysis, researchers found that the risk of anxiety risk increases as sedentary behavior increases and, specifically, sitting time spikes one's likelihood of experiencing anxiety."", 'Instead:', ""If you work at a desk all day, you're not doomed. Get up and walk around every ninety minutes. Offset your sitting time with regular exercise, which halves your risk of anxiety and depression."", '5. Your phone ', 'A 2014 study by Baylor University found that American students spend an average of nine hours a day on their phone. Of course, technology vastly improves our lives in innumerable ways. But too much of it makes us anxious. Screen-based entertainment increases central nervous system arousal, which can amplify anxiety.

So clock out: In your calendar, schedule a defined, consistent time at night to stop working. When time's up, mark that task complete and go take care of yourself."", '7. Netflix and hanging out', 'You may think snuggling up on the couch and watching a movie will help you unwind, but research disproves this trend.', ""In one study, participants felt more depressed and anxious after watching just two hours of TV than those who didn't. Another study found that those with anxiety and depression spend significantly more time on the computer and watching television. While resting reduces anxiety short-term, research reveals that its effect is short lived, particularly compared with exercise."", 'Instead:', ""Do anything but watch TV when you're done with work.

Furthermore, participating in intergroup anxiety increases one's anxious behaviors."", 'Instead:', ""Seek out people who level your mood. After you hang out with someone, ask yourself if you feel stable and well or if you're hyped up and on edge. It's easy to spend less time with certain people once you've decided they're bad for your health."", ' ', ""If the annoyance, pain and performance impairment of day-to-day anxiety isn't enough to quit these bad habits, perhaps this is: According to Harvard Medical School, anxiety is implicated in heart disease, migraines, chronic respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal conditions."", 'Despite our youth, chronic anxiety is not sustainable.

"Too Much Sugar Linked To Reduced Memory, Brain Volume"," Two more studies link added sugar in the kind we may still find innocuously included in sugary cocktails, drinks known affectionately as ""healthy drinks"", but which are not beneficial for health..","[""The sugar-brain connection isn't just a theory anymore. There's some fairly convincing and reproducible evidence that too much sugar in the diet is linked to cognitive and brain deficits. Two new papers, both deriving data from the long-running Framingham Heart Study, bear this out. One study finds that sugary drinks are linked to pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease: Poor memory and reduced brain volume in certain areas. The other study finds that artificial sweeteners aren't much better they're linked to a greater risk of stroke and of dementia. So it seems like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't, at least when it comes to sweetened drinks."", ' Shutterstock', ""The first of the studies, from Boston University School of Medicine, followed more than 4,200 people, periodically testing them for memory and cognition, and scanning their brains with MRI to measure volume. The participants also filled out questionnaires about their food intake, including sugary drink consumption (including both soda and fruit juices). Sugary drinks are a great way to study excess sugar, since they have almost no redeeming nutritional qualities, like protein or fiber to slow their absorption it's like a straight drug to the system."", ""It turned out that people who consumed more sweetened drinks had poorer memory and reduced overall brain volume (particularly in the hippocampus, the area that's known to house short-term memory), compared to people who didn't drink sugary drinks."", 'In fact, the authors calculated that one to two sugary drinks per day was associated with 1.6 years of brain aging; more than two drinks per day was associated with two extra years of aging. For memory, the association was even more pronounced: One to two, and greater than two, sugary drinks per day corresponded to 5.8 and 11 years of brain aging, respectively.', ""The other study, also using data from the Framingham participants, looked at the link between sugary drink consumption, artificially sweetened drink consumption and dementia and stroke. It didn't find a link between sugary drinks and dementia or stroke, but it did find a link between artificially sweetened drink consumption and both types of brain disease. In fact, participants who drank at least one artificially sweetened drink per day were three times as likely to develop stroke and almost three times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why didn't the second study find a link between sugar and brain disease, as the first one did? There are a number of possible reasons, says study author Matthew Pase. One is that in our sample, people didn't frequently consume regular soda more drank diet drinks. So it's possible we were underpowered since sugary drinks just weren't that widely consumed. The other point he makes is that the people who often consumed sugary beverages were at risk of other diseases so they may not have had time to develop the brain diseases that were being tested for."", ""Despite the lack of sugar-brain disease connection in the second study, Pase says he strongly believes in the connection between sugar and brain disease, given the results of his first one, and the fast-growing body of other work that's illuminating the connection. We know that sugar beverages and excess sugar are associated with metabolic disease, he says. The brain relies on a steady flow of blood. Metabolic and vascular diseases don't just happen in the body they happen in the brain, too. Earlier work has shown in both mice and humans that impaired glucose function is linked not only to cognitive deficits but also to the patterns of protein dysfunction (amyloid-beta and tau) that are associated with Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why artificial sweetener consumption would be linked to brain disease is another question. Reverse causation could be a factor, whereby people with already-existing health problems are more likely to drink artificially sweetened drinks in an effort to be healthier for instance people who already have diabetes are more likely to switch to diet drinks as a result, and they're also more likely to develop dementia. Or it could be that diet drinks screw up the brain's feedback system, so people unwittingly seek out sugar elsewhere. Artificial sweetener has also been shown to tweak one's gut bacteria, the disruption of which can be linked to glucose intolerance and metabolic disease."", ""The bottom line is that sugar is just as bad for the brain as it is for other organs, maybe worse. Considering that the brain is charged with a lot of critical processes, especially the ones that make us who we are memory, empathy, emotion it's not a good idea to mess with it by consuming the wrong things. After researchers figured out that sugar isn't healthy, we switched to artificial sweetener now we know that it's not without its own risks. Until science figures out a safe way to sweeten liquids, it might be that water, coffee and tea are the only smart options.""]",0.26666666664

The company doesn’t hold him responsible, saying his role and possible implication “has been a point of attention.”', '“This is another setback in a long series of bad decisions for Holcim and a necessary step to ensure the company can make a clean start,” Bernstein analyst Phil Roseberg wrote in a note. The resulting “management vacuum at this time is likely to set back their already ambitious goals.”', 'Olsen got the top job as a compromise to get the 2015 merger through. He was executive vice president of operations at Lafarge SA, the French company that merged with Switzerland’s Holcim and was running the Syrian plant.\xa0His departure comes after LafargeHolcim said an internal investigation found “significant errors of judgement” after money was paid to armed Syrian groups to keep the site operating. While local and regional managers made the decisions, “selected members of group management were aware.”', 'A change at the helm of LafargeHolcim was decided just as Olsen was working to capture promised benefits of the merger. Last month he signaled optimism about growth in some markets including the U.S. and said the company is expecting double-digit like-for-like increase in a key measure of profit. The perceived improvement came after he had struggled to convince investors of the merger benefits. In November, some analysts expressed skepticism about whether it could reach a 2018 profit target set amid asset sales and restructuring.', 'Shares rose 0.3 percent to 58.10 francs at 11:28 a.m. in Zurich, trailing the gains on the Swiss SMI Index, which advanced 1.5 percent as European shares rose in the wake of the French election results. This year, the cement maker has added about 10 percent.', 'After a difficult start, Olsen’s credibility “has gained momentum throughout the last year and confidence in management had started to improve,” Deutsche Bank analyst Xavier Marchand wrote in a note. The resignation brings “uncertainty to group strategy and performance as it could be some time for a successor to be appointed.”', 'The controversy over the Syria dealings escalated when France’s Economy Ministry confirmed in January it had filed a complaint with prosecutors the previous September against LafargeHolcim activities in Syria.\xa0Confirming legal proceedings continue in France, the company said Monday the board has concluded the CEO was not responsible nor thought to be aware of any wrongdoings.', 'An internal probe found funds were given to third parties who then made arrangements with a number of groups, including “sanctioned parties.” The company said the payments were unacceptable. Islamic State fighters seized the plant in September 2014.', 'On Monday, LafargeHolcim said operating a plant in a war zone and the “can-do” approach to maintain operations led those involved in the running of the plant to “seriously misjudge” the situation.', 'The resignation “is driven by my conviction that it will contribute to addressing strong tensions that have recently arisen around the Syria case,” Olsen said in the statement. “While I was absolutely not involved in, nor even aware of, any wrongdoing I believe my departure will contribute to bringing back serenity to a company that has been exposed for months on this case.”', 'Olsen, who has both French and U.S. nationality, joined Lafarge in 1999. He was a compromise candidate after Holcim demanded changes to an initial merger agreement that would have installed Lafarge chief Bruno Lafont as head of the new entity. LafargeHolcim said in March that Lafont won’t stand for re-election to the board.']",0.0

"S.E. Hinton’s ""The Outsiders,"" a teen classic, turns 50"," 50 years ago, Robert “Butch”.","['We’ll be getting a look INSIDE “THE OUTSIDERS” this morning. Serena Altschul has a close-up on the classic novel and teen movie:', 'For fans of the 1983 coming-of-age film, “The Outsiders,” maybe the only thing better than watching the movie … is watching it with Rob Lowe.', '“Look how handsome Matt is! Looks like a movie star,” said Lowe.', '“Frankly, you are all ridiculously handsome,” said Altschul.', 'It was a cast of hearthrobs and Hollywood stars-in-the-making. Along with Lowe, there’s Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio and Tom Cruise, wearing prosthetic teeth.', '“He hasn’t taken his fake tooth out yet; he does that after the rumble,” Lowe said.', 'Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, “The Outsiders” didn’t just help launch careers. For then-18-year-old Lowe, it saved his. “’The Outsiders’ was my last audition that I was going to go before I sort of gave it up,” he said. “If I hadn’t been cast in ‘The Outsiders,’ I wouldn’t be an actor, ‘cause that was the last train leaving the station for me.”', 'Lowe holds the film close to his heart …. and a big reason is Susan Eloise Hinton, the woman who came up with the story more than half a century ago.', '“Suzie was able to capture a moment in everybody’s life that everybody will have, and that is that adolescent striving for the next chapter, which is what ‘The Outsiders’ is about,” he said. “There’s always going to be an audience for that, and there always has been an audience for that.”', 'She’s known to her legions of readers as S.E. Hinton, the initials a suggestion from her editors.', 'As she recalled, “They said, ‘We’re wondering if you use your initials, S.E., on this because we’re afraid the first reviewers will pick up the book, see what the content matter is, and review it with a bias.’ Like a girl wouldn’t know anything about this.”', 'In fact, she knew plenty.', '“The Outsiders” was published in 1967. Fifty years later, it’s considered a classic, and a pioneer in the young adult fiction category. It has sold more than 10 million copies, been translated into dozens of languages, and is part of the core curriculum in schools across the country.', 'And to think Hinton started writing it when she was only 15. “Well, it was about 40 pages long, single-space typed. And then I did most of the work on it my junior year in high school, where I made a D in creative writing.”', 'Now 68, Hinton took Altschul back to that very school in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the city she was raised in, and still calls home.', '“Everybody had their own little space to hang out in. And the Socials hung out down here at this entrance. That was their spot.”', '“The Outsiders” is about adolescent angst and the battles between two groups: The affluent “Socs” (short for Socials) and the lower-class “Greasers” centered around the Curtis brothers: Ponyboy, Darrel and Sodapop (played by Lowe in the film).', '“You have to understand, for me, look, I’m 53 years old and I can walk out of this building, down the street and there will be a 12-year-old girl who will go, ‘Sodapop!’” he said.\xa0', '“They know who you are,” said Altschul.\xa0', '“’You’re twelve!’”', '“What is it about Sodapop, and Ponyboy, that resonates with so many people?”', '“The world’s biggest fans, first of all, are girls for ‘The Outsiders.’ And I think at the age they’re reading it -- they’re seventh and eighth grade girls -- and they’re reading ‘The Outsiders’ and they’re going, ‘Oh, so this is what boys are really like.’”', 'Hinton said she gets many letters saying “Your book changed my life.”', '“That scares me, frankly,” she said. “Because who am I to change anybody’s life? The only way I can deal with the impact ‘The Outsiders’ has had worldwide is to think that it was meant to be written, I was chosen to write it, and it’s out there.”', 'The movie was shot almost entirely in Tulsa. The building used as the home of the Curtis brothers is being turned into a museum.', 'Hinton was a special advisor to Francis Ford Coppola during the filming. And to the young actors, she was something more: “She embraced us,” Lowe said. “She made us feel safe, she helped us navigate the very complicated Francis world. And she loved us.”', 'To which Hinton said, “I loved it. I loved every minute.”', '“God, she used to get on me for my southern California speak,” Lowe said. “She once bet me $60 that I couldn’t get through lunch without saying her word gnarly. ’Oh my God it’s so gnarly!’ ‘Francis had us shooting this scene, it was so gnarly!’', '“I don’t think I made it through lunch. I think I still owe her the 60!”', 'What is so enduring about ‘The Outsiders?’ Why does it connect with young people? For Hinton, it’s simple: “When you reread the book, at least I do, you just think it’s so over the top emotionally. I would never have the nerve to write that un-self-consciously again. But at that time, that was exactly the way I felt. And I think that’s one reason why kids identify so strongly. They’re gonna like that.”', 'Hinton has fans the world over … and one of her biggest has this message for her: “I would say thanks for being a mom when we all needed one,” Lowe said.', 'To watch a trailer for “The Outsiders” click on the video player below.\xa0', 'For more info:', 'Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the new 24/7 digital news network.

Drones helped aid organizations identify areas of need in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, locate mines displaced by the massive Balkan floods in 2014, and document the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in 2015.', 'Now, companies are testing to see how drones can regularly deliver humanitarian aid, rather than just inform NGOs where to go.', ""San Francisco-based Otherlab recently launched the world's most advanced industrial paper airplanes to do just that. The APSARA glider is made of biodegradable materials, and can carry more than two pounds of lifesaving supplies, such as blood and vaccines. When dropped out of a cargo airplane, the drones' interior tech helps them steer themselves in a spiral motion to a designated location using GPS and autopilot. It can land within a 33-foot radius of its intended destination."", ""Another project wants survivors of natural disasters to get their aid and eat it, too. Windhorse Aerospace created an inexpensive prototype called Pouncer, whose wings are packed with food. The protective covers surrounding the food can double as shelter, while the the drone's plywood frame can be used as firewood."", ""It can be extremely difficult (and even dangerous) for aid workers to get to people in hard-to-reach areas, whether it's a rural region of a developing nation, or a country plagued by conflict. But if you cut humans out of the equation, the seemingly insurmountable task gets a little easier."", 'Drones are helping animal scientists and researchers make strides in their fields, simply by giving them views they never had before.', 'For example, earlier this month researchers at Oregon State University\'s Marine Mammal Institute captured rare aerial footage of blue whales ""lunge-feeding"" on krill. With drones, they were able to gain a new perspective; the whales actually decide which patches of krill are worth going after, based on the amount of energy required and the ""nutritional payoff.""', ""It's just one example of many in which drones can aid in animal research. Ecologists have used drones to track critically endangered birds, count sea lions, support the Jane Goodall Institute's chimp efforts, and even help dwindling populations of the southern right whale recover."", ""Drones don't just help scientists observe animals in their natural habitats. They can also help protect endangered species from poachers.\xa0"", 'For the past several years, anti-poaching groups have tapped into the power of drones to save rhinos and elephants in countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Even in places where poaching is banned, poachers break into national parks and kill animals, contributing to the illegal wildlife trade industry that rakes in tens of billions of dollars every year.', ""But drones can act as a sort of high-tech park ranger, monitoring wide expanses of land to intercept poaching gangs. And their flight paths aren't random — everything is based on analytical models and massive amounts of data, including incidents of past poaching, the movement of rhinos with ankle trackers, the weather, and more.\xa0"", ""Unfortunately, these drone programs can be very costly, and don't fit every conservation scenario (some drones' sounds can scare elephants outside park boundaries, for instance). But a couple of increasingly successful examples include the Lindbergh Foundation's Air Shepherd program and the World Wildlife Fund (with funding from Google), which continue to test solutions in various countries."", ""While elephant and rhino poaching might be the most visible wildlife crime issues, it's worth noting that drones also help track illegal fishing, which can deplete resources, kill off species, and affect whole ecosystems."", ""Illegal logging doesn't just leave the visible destruction of trees in its wake — it also threatens species, destroys ecosystems, and ruins the livelihoods of local communities (and often damages their sacred land)."", ""Enter drones. A number of groups have employed the technology to catch illegal loggers in the act — something that isn't easy to do when it's happening in the middle of rainforest."", 'The Amazon Basin Conservation Association in Peru started using toy planes made of foam to snap photos of loggers and miners, and the ensuing deforestation happening in the Amazon. The drones weigh less than five pounds, with greater range than your typical quadcopter, but they can still carry a standard camera. The group discovered various illegal mines, and used the evidence to help prevent them from moving into protected areas.', ""The issue also directly affects Indigenous communities living in forest regions. Last year, southern Guyana's Wapichan community wanted the government to take action against illegal loggers and miners, but they didn't have proof. So, using YouTube DIY videos, they built their own drone — a fixed-wing glider controlled by flight-tracking software with a GoPro attached. They were able to fly into otherwise inaccessible places, and confirmed not only that loggers were felling trees in protected areas, but also that illegal mines were polluting water sources their community relied on."", ""How do you help people who need medical attention in rural areas that aren't accessible by ambulance? Three words: autonomous medical drones."", ""Last year, a tech company called Lung Biotechnology PBC acquired 1,000 of EHang's drones, capable of carrying humans, for its Manufactured Organ Transport vehicle system (MOTH). The collaboration will allow Lung Biotechnology to deliver hundreds of organs to those in need every day. A similar drone, called the Angel Drone, can deliver blood and organ transplants to people in Outback Australia. \xa0"", 'Other drones can deliver first aid quicker than traditional ambulances, and even help fight malaria in Southeast Asia by mapping the communities where the disease spreads.\xa0', ""If you thought drones couldn't help advance sexual health and reproductive rights, think again."", ""In Ghana, the United Nations Population Fund (the U.N.'s arm in charge of improving family planning in the developing world) is flying drones to deliver birth control pills, condoms, and other medical supplies to people in remote regions, where there is little-to-no access to contraceptives. The project is still in pilot phase, but if it's successful, it could expand to Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique."", ""Drones are also helping activists navigate anti-abortion laws in the developed world. In 2015, four women's rights groups launched drones to deliver abortion pills from Germany across the border to Poland, where women were only allowed to have legal abortions in cases of rape or incest. Several of the same groups did a similar action in 2016 in Northern Ireland. The act was largely symbolic, but brilliantly helped to raise awareness of the issue.\xa0"", '. في ظل التطور نحو التميز وسعي الحكومة إلى الخدمات الذكية في خدمة المجتمع ومواكبة ما هو متبع في كبريات المدن العالمية ، قامت إدارة النفايات ببلدية دبي بتدشين طائرة من دون طيار لمراقبة المواقع التي يتم الإشراف عليها بمكبات النفايات في القصيص وجبل علي وورسان بالإضافة إلى المواقع الاستثمارية .

Photo credit ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images.', 'Overemphasizing the shift in the energy markets since 2005 is hard. Had you predicted the shift that was to come, you would have been widely deemed a lunatic. But let me take you back there for a moment and remind you of where we stood, and what played out over the next decade.', ""U.S. oil production had seemingly peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day (BPD), and by 2005 had declined for 35 years. Production in 2005 stood at 5.2 million BPD, and crude oil imports had reached 10.1 million BPD -- just under 50% of total U.S. petroleum consumption. The U.S. economy was in a precarious situation, highly dependent on oil imports from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia; countries whose interests weren't always aligned with our own."", ""Concerns about oil supplies weren't limited to the U.S. In 2005 energy investment banker Matt Simmons published Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy. Simmons helped set off a fierce debate about whether Saudi Arabia -- and the world as a whole -- had reached a global peak in oil production. This thesis gained traction over the next three years, as oil prices surged past $100/bbl and helped push the world into recession. The U.S. desperately needed a miracle to reverse decades of growing energy dependence. Actually one was in the works, unbeknownst to most Americans."", 'The situation in natural gas was much the same. U.S. gas production had peaked in 1973 at 21.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). By 1986 production had fallen to 16 Tcf, but in 2005 had recovered a bit to 18.1 Tcf. Not only did he sound the alarm on oil, but Matt Simmons had also predicted in 2003 that with certainty, by 2005 the US would embark on a long-term natural gas crisis for which the only solution was to pray.', ""Simmons wasn't the only one to think that a natural gas crisis was imminent. In fact, it was widely believed that this would be the case, and companies began to plan and build liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to cope with the expected shortfall. Natural gas prices began to spike ever higher during 2005, and the Henry Hub Gulf Coast Natural Gas Spot Price crossed $15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) by year-end."", 'Insiders like Matt Simmons and T. Boone Pickens initially appeared to be correct in forecasting an energy crisis for the U.S. But these insiders were seemingly unaware that oil and gas producers were refining a technique that would turn the world energy markets upside down.', 'Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking had been around since the late 1940s and had been used extensively to promote higher production rates from conventional oil and gas wells. Fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and a proppant (like sand) down an oil or gas well under high pressure to break open channels (fractures) in the reservoir rock trapping the deposit. Oil and gas do not travel easily through certain reservoir types, which is why they need to be fractured. The proppant is designed to hold those channels open, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow to the well bore.', 'But legendary oilman George Mitchell was one of the key players behind the innovation that made such a dramatic change in the trajectory of the U.S. oil and gas markets. Mitchell combined fracking with horizontal drilling -- another standard technique used in the oil and gas industry. Like fracking, horizontal drilling had been around a while and had been widely applied in the oil and gas industry since the 1980s.', 'Horizontal drilling involves drilling down to an oil or gas deposit and then turning the drill horizontal to the formation to access a greater fraction of the deposit. These horizontal laterals can be 5,000 to 10,000 feet in length, and hydraulically fracturing them enabled economic oil and gas production for the first time from shale formations scattered across the U.S.', ""Success in natural gas came first. From 2005, U.S. natural gas production rose for 10 straight years. The previous production record set in 1973 was obliterated as production grew 50% from 2005 to 2015 to reach 27 Tcf. In the process, the U.S. became the world's largest natural gas producer."", 'U.S. oil production started to rise in 2008, and the next seven years marked the fastest oil production increase in U.S. history. Instead of continued declines, production of U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids increased by an astounding six million BPD. Net imports of crude oil and products to the U.S. fell from 12.5 million BPD in 2005 to 4.7 million BPD in 2015. The U.S. began exporting finished products and even crude oil into the market', 'The dramatic shift in the U.S. oil and gas industry sent shockwaves not only across the country but around the world. Ultimately OPEC responded to the threat with a price war to win back market share that was being lost. To date, it looks like that strategy has failed, but this is a game with many innings still to be played.']",0.4666666666399999

Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U.S. companies to keep jobs in this country. Those who say the economy is getting better outnumber those who say it’s getting worse by the biggest margin in 15 years in Post-ABC polling.', 'But the president’s balance sheet overall tilts toward the negative. Majorities of Americans say Trump has not accomplished much during his first months as president. Meanwhile, he shows little improvement on his temperament and honesty, and while he’s gained ground on empathy, over 6 in 10 still say he does not understand the problems of people like them.', '[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]', 'With a week remaining before his 100th day in office, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative accomplishment, having been dealt a major setback when Republicans in Congress decided not to proceed with a vote on a health-care bill supported by the White House. His clearest achievement is the successful nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.', 'Executive actions on trade, immigration, climate and government organization have pointed the direction he wants to take the country, though his controversial proposed travel ban that affects a number of Muslim-majority nations remains blocked by the courts. Trump and others in his administration have attacked the courts, accusing them of overreach, but nearly 6 in 10 people see their actions as a legitimate role for the judicial branch.', 'Overseas, he has demonstrated his willingness to use military force, with targeted strikes in Syria and the use of one of the biggest non-nuclear devices in the U.S. arsenal in Afghanistan. But tensions with North Korea remain high and the administration’s policy in the Middle East remains cloudy.', 'The 100-day marker is in part an artificial measuring post for any president, but by comparison, Trump has reached this point in his presidency faring worse to much worse than other recent presidents. An electorate that was deeply divided throughout the 2016 campaign remains so today, with opposition seemingly hardened and unyielding on most questions regarding his presidency.', 'The president’s approval rating stands at 42 percent, the lowest recorded at this stage of a presidency dating to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump’s 53 percent disapproval rating is 14 percentage points higher than Bill Clinton’s 39 percent disapproval in April 1993, the worst before Trump. Eight years ago, then-president Barack Obama’s approval was 69 percent, his disapproval 26 percent.', 'The Post-ABC poll finds 43 percent of Americans said they strongly disapprove of Trump’s performance.

In the spring of 1993, 21 percent said they strongly disapproved of Clinton’s performance.', 'Americans split at 35 percent apiece on whether Trump is doing a better or worse job than expected, with the rest saying he’s neither above nor below their expectations.', 'There are no signs of major slippage in support among those who voted for Trump. His approval rating among those who cast ballots for him stands at 94 percent. Among Republicans, it is 84 percent. Asked of those who voted for him whether they regret doing so, 2 percent say they do, while 96 percent say supporting Trump was the right thing to do.When asked if they would vote for him again, 96 percent say they would, which is higher than the 85 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who say they would support her again.', 'Trump is also satisfying the substantial share of the electorate that voted for him with some reservation. Among Trump voters who say they were “somewhat enthusiastic” or less excited about supporting him, 88 percent approve of his current performance and 79 percent say he understands the problems of people like them.', 'Bill Clinton also had a rocky start to his presidency, which colored public judgments of his presidency by the 100-day mark. Although just 42 percent say Trump has accomplished either a great deal or a good amount so far, that is slightly higher than the 37 percent who said the same about Clinton in 1993.', 'Similarly, judgments on whether campaign promises have been kept put Trump on about equal footing with Bill Clinton — 44 percent and 42 percent respectively.

At this point in their presidencies, 74 percent said Obama was honest, 62 percent said George W. Bush was honest and a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed 61 percent said Clinton was honest.', 'Another gap is on the question of whether Trump can be trusted in a crisis. The poll finds that 43 percent — about the same as Trump’s approval rating — say he can be trusted; 73 percent said so for Obama and 65 percent for George W. Bush at this point in their presidencies.', 'On the specific question of how Trump has dealt with North Korea, 46 percent say he has been about right in his posture, 37 percent say he is too aggressive and just 7 percent say he is too cautious.', 'On most questions about his performance or characteristics, Trump receives more negative than positive ratings. The most notable exception is his effort to pressure U.S. companies on the issues of keeping jobs at home, where 73 percent of Americans approve, including 54 percent of Democrats.', 'Another issue where the public sides with Trump rather than his critics is whether it is a conflict of interest for Trump to spend time at his own properties. A 54 percent majority say he has the right to travel where he wants to go. But on another question, about 6 in 10 Americans say they disapprove of the major White House roles Trump has given to his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner.', 'Trump has net negative ratings on such questions as temperament — just as he did during the campaign — as well as on judgment to serve as president, and on whether he operates from a consistent set of principles. He has said he likes to be unpredictable.', 'Half disapprove of the major changes he has proposed for government spending, while nearly 6 in 10 say he is out of touch with the concerns of most people.

A Monday event with students at the University of Chicago will be followed by an awards ceremony in Boston; a series of public remarks as well as private paid speeches in the United States and Europe; and an appearance at the Brandenburg Gate in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel.', 'And yet, Mr. Obama’s supporters, who have been waiting eagerly for the former president to respond to his successor’s accusations and policy reversals, are likely to be disappointed.', 'Even as he witnesses President Trump’s relentless and chaotic assault on his legacy, Mr. Obama remains stubbornly committed to the idea that there is only one president at a time. Those closest to him say the former president does not intend to confront Mr. Trump directly on immigration, health care, foreign policy or the environment during any of his events.', '“Why are we not hearing from him? We’ve got to hear from him,” said Sarah Kovner, a New York City Democratic activist who raised more than $1 million for Mr. Obama’s campaigns. “Democrats are desperate.”', '“Everything that Trump is doing really requires a response,” Ms. Kovner added.', 'Mr. Obama and a small cadre of former White House aides in his Washington office know that anything he says in public, no matter how veiled, will be interpreted as criticism of Mr. Trump.', 'Mr. Obama’s aides say he will also not criticize Mr. Trump in his private paid speeches. The aides would not say how much Mr. Obama will be paid per speech, but former President Bill Clinton averaged more than $200,000 per speech between 2001 and 2015; former President George W. Bush is reportedly paid $100,000 to $175,000 for each appearance.', 'Aides have rejected the idea that Mr. Obama should actively wage a public feud against Mr. Trump, with whom he has not spoken since the inauguration. They believe that such a fight would give the current president the high-profile political foil he wants to further energize his conservative supporters.', 'Mr. Obama has also concluded that his voice is not essential in the daily back-and-forth. His aides note that a new level of civic activism among Democrats eager to challenge Mr. Trump has emerged without much encouragement from the former leader of the Democratic Party. And many of Mr. Trump’s attacks on Obama-era policies — like the Affordable Care Act — have so far failed or stalled.', 'Instead, Mr. Obama is preparing remarks that focus on broader themes he hopes will keep him above the cable-television combat and the Capitol Hill debates: civic engagement, the health of the planet, the need for diplomacy, civil rights and the development of a new generation of young American leaders.', 'Mr. Obama is not the first president to try to avoid the political fights that consumed his time in office. Mr. Bush resisted pressure from his aides and supporters to criticize his successor during the months after Mr. Obama took office.', '“People around him wanted him to do it,” recalled James Glassman, the founding director of the George W. Bush Institute. “People would come to me and say, ‘Can’t you get the president to defend No Child Left Behind?’ His legacy was about to be wiped off the face of the earth. The answer was no. That’s not the way he saw his post-presidency.”', 'Mr. Glassman said that Mr. Bush’s keep-quiet approach toward Mr. Obama was shaped by what he saw as unfair criticism by former President Jimmy Carter of his father, the elder President George Bush.', '“I would try to get him to do things like talk about immigration policy and say the things he said as president,” Mr. Glassman said of Mr. Bush. “He would absolutely not do it.”', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', 'But rarely has an outgoing president faced a successor like Mr. Trump.', 'In the weeks after winning the White House, Mr. Trump assembled a cabinet intended to eradicate most of Mr. Obama’s accomplishments. Once in office, Mr. Trump accused the former president of wiretapping him, without offering any evidence, and he said on Twitter that Mr. Obama was a “Bad (or sick) guy!” Mr. Trump also accused his predecessor of being behind national security leaks, and he all but blamed Mr. Obama for Syria’s chemical weapons attacks.', 'The pressure on Mr. Obama to enter the fray has steadily increased as Mr. Trump moved to reverse Obama-era environmental protections, ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, abandon trade deals, eliminate progressive regulations and install a conservative Supreme Court justice.', 'Through it all, Mr. Obama has stayed mostly silent. (During a conference call with thousands of despairing supporters a week after the election, Mr. Obama said only: “Don’t mope. And don’t get complacent.”)', 'After the Obama family moved into a nine-bedroom mansion a few miles from the White House in January, they began a series of vacations, each captured in grainy snapshots posted online.', 'Mr. Obama quickly left Washington for Palm Springs, Calif., and then it was off to a private island in the British Virgin Islands with the British billionaire Richard Branson, where he was photographed kitesurfing.', 'More recently, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, spent nearly a month in French Polynesia. A snapshot of the former president taking a picture of Michelle on the deck of Mr. Geffen’s yacht, the Rising Sun, went viral on the internet.', 'On Monday, the former president will return to his adopted hometown, Chicago, for a conversation with a half-dozen young people in front of an audience of college students.', 'As he begins his paid speeches, Mr. Obama, who is represented by the Harry Walker Agency, is scheduled to engage in a private conversation with the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for the employees of the A&E television network.', 'On May 7 in Boston, Mr. Obama will accept the Profile in Courage Award given annually by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. He will deliver a speech at the library’s black-tie dinner. His remarks — built around the theme of what courage means in today’s world — will not name Mr. Trump.', 'Later in May, Mr. Obama will be with his White House chef and friend, Sam Kass, in Italy for a session at the Global Food Innovation Summit about the effect of climate change on food sources. On May 25, Mr. Obama is to participate in a public discussion at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, joined by Ms. Merkel, a close ally during his time in office.', 'In both European countries, Mr. Obama will also deliver paid speeches.', 'Some longtime supporters still hope to see Mr. Obama eventually return to the impassioned oratory they remember from the 2008 and 2012 campaign trail.', '“Everyone is anxious,” said John Morgan, a lawyer and one of Mr. Obama’s longtime donors.', 'But Mr. Morgan said it made more sense for Mr. Obama to keep a low profile until next year, when Democratic candidates for the House and Senate will need help winning re-election.', '“You have got to pick your battles. Timing is everything,” Mr. Morgan said. “If you come out 100 days after the election throwing haymakers, I think your credibility wanes. He’s better to save himself for the fall of 2018 and speak from a higher perch.”', 'Louis Frillman, a board member of Organizing for Action, the group that grew out of Mr. Obama’s campaign, said Democrats needed to learn not to rely only on the former president. But he said it would be up to Mr. Obama to decide how much to engage.', '“I’m not going to give him public advice,” Mr. Frillman said. “He’ll know how to deal with things in due course.”']",0.26666666664

Although such spear phishing\xa0attacks aren’t new, hackers are discovering that mimicking game-industry promotions can be very effective.

The national agency in charge of cyber security chose as its mascot a character from Sword Art Online, a popular anime set in a virtual-reality game.', 'GungHo Online Entertainment Inc., the maker of Puzzle & Dragons, Colopl Inc. and other Japanese game makers have also become very good at making money from free-to-play smartphone titles. Japanese spend on average $30 a month on smartphone games, more than double their counterparts in the U.S. and triple the U.K., according to market researcher App Annie. The most profitable title of 2016 worldwide wasn’t Pokemon Go or Clash of Clans, but Monster Strike, a popular Japanese game.', '“These attackers will follow an economic trail, because they know the gaming companies have identified specific patterns of user behavior,” Issa said. “They’ll take their time doing homework about what games are popular and what types of promotions are going on right now.”', 'Japanese publishers combine psychology, art and big data to get players to return as often as possible and eventually pay for digital extras like weapons or skills. GungHo constantly plies its users with promotions, offering new levels and playable monster characters. It also conditions players to respond to time pressure, with some events lasting just a few hours.', '“The game’s large user base may be the reason why it attracts scams” and GungHo has an internal team to deal with particularly egregious cases, said Haruka Sudo, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based company. GungHo never gives away its virtual trinkets for free, she said.', 'While the magic-stone breach came from an unclassified threat group, many can be traced to state-based actors in China and North Korea, according to FireEye. They target specific enterprises in energy, chemical engineering and construction, the security firm said.\xa0', 'Japan enacted the Basic Act on Cybersecurity in November 2014 and established the National Center for Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity the following year, but still doesn’t have laws requiring companies to disclose breaches unless they involve loss of personal data.', '“Japan is just beginning to put this important infrastructure in place, so it’s not yet ready for cyber attacks,” said Daisuke Tatsuno, a partner covering intellectual property and information technology matters at Baker & McKenzie’s Tokyo office. “Private companies have a general awareness that such attacks are possible, but few are taking concrete steps to prepare.”']",0.26666666664

A young prince is reimagining Saudi Arabia. Can he make his vision come true?," The Washington Correspondent's Office, Is it?","['RIYADH, Saudi Arabia', 'Two years into his campaign as change agent in this conservative oil kingdom, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appears to be gaining the confidence and political clout to push his agenda of economic and social reform.', 'The young prince outlined his plans in a nearly 90-minute conversation Tuesday night at his office here. Aides said it was his first lengthy on-the-record interview in months. He offered detailed explanations about foreign policy, plans to privatize oil giant Saudi Aramco, strategy for investment in domestic industry, and liberalization of the entertainment sector, despite opposition from some religious conservatives.', 'Mohammed bin Salman said that the crucial requirement for reform is public willingness to change a traditional society. “The most concerning thing is if the Saudi people are not convinced. If the Saudi people are convinced, the sky is the limit,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.', 'Change seems increasingly desired in this young, restless country. A recent Saudi poll found that 85 percent of the public, if forced to choose, would support the government rather than religious authorities on policy matters, said Abdullah al-Hokail, the head of the government’s public opinion center. He added that 77 percent of those surveyed supported the government’s “Vision 2030” reform plan, and that 82 percent favored music performances at public gatherings attended by men and women. Though these aren’t independently verified numbers, they do indicate the direction of popular feeling, which Saudis say is matched by anecdotal evidence.', '“MBS,” as the deputy crown prince is known, said that he was “very optimistic” about President Trump. He described Trump as “a president who will bring America back to the right track” after Barack Obama, whom Saudi officials mistrusted. “Trump has not yet completed 100 days, and he has restored all the alliances of the U.S. with its conventional allies.”', 'A sign of the kingdom’s embrace of the Trump administration was the visit here this week by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the Obama administration had criticized the Saudi war in Yemen, Mattis discussed the possibility of additional U.S. support if the Houthi insurgents there don’t agree to a U.N.-brokered settlement. (I traveled to Saudi Arabia as part of the press corps accompanying Mattis.)', 'Mohammed bin Salman has been courting Russia, as well as the United States, and he offered an intriguing explanation of Saudi Arabia’s goal in this diplomacy. “The main objective is not to have Russia place all its cards in the region behind Iran,” he said. To convince Russia that Riyadh is a better bet than Tehran, the Saudis have been “coordinating our oil policies recently” with Moscow, he said, which “could be the most important economic deal for Russia in modern times.”', 'There’s less apparent political tension than a year ago, when many analysts saw a rivalry between Mohammed bin Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is officially next in line for the throne but is less prominent than his cousin. Whatever the succession proves to be, the deputy crown prince appears to be firmly in control of Saudi military strategy, foreign policy and economic planning. He has gathered a team of technocrats who are much younger and more activist than the kingdom’s past leadership.', 'Reform plans appear to be moving ahead slowly but steadily. Mohammed bin Salman said that the budget deficit had been cut; non-oil revenue increased 46 percent from 2014 to 2016 and is forecast to grow another 12 percent this year. Unemployment and housing remain problems, he said, and improvement in those areas isn’t likely until between 2019 and 2021.', 'The biggest economic change is the plan to privatize about 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, which Mohammed bin Salman said will take place next year. This public offering would probably raise hundreds of billions of dollars and be the largest such sale in financial history. The exact size of the offering will depend on financial-market demand and the availability of good options for investing the proceeds, he told me. The rationale for selling a share of the kingdom’s oil treasure is to raise money to diversify the economy away from reliance on energy. One priority is mining, which would tap an estimated $1.3 trillion in potential mineral wealth.', 'The Saudi official listed other investment targets: creating a domestic arms industry, reducing the $60 billion to $80 billion the kingdom spends annually to buy weapons abroad; producing automobiles in Saudi Arabia to replace the roughly $14 billion the government spends annually for imported vehicles; and creating domestic entertainment and tourism industries to capture some of the $22 billion that Saudis spend traveling overseas each year.', 'The entertainment industry is a proxy for the larger puzzle of how to unlock the Saudi economy. Changes have begun. A Japanese orchestra that included women performed here this month, before a mixed audience of men and women. A Comic Con took place in Jeddah recently, with young men and women dressing up as characters from the TV show “Supernatural” and other favorites. Comedy clubs feature sketch comedians (but no female stand-up comics, yet).', 'These options are a modest revolution for a Saudi Arabia where the main entertainment venues, until recently, were restaurants and shopping malls. The modern world, in all its raucousness, is coming, for better or worse. King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh hosted a Monster Jam last month with souped-up trucks. There are plans for a Six Flags theme park south of Riyadh.', 'Maya al-Athel, one of the dozens of young people hatching plans at the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, said in an interview that she’d like to bring a Museum of Ice Cream, like one she found in New York, to the kingdom.', '“We want to change the culture,” said Ahmed al-Khatib, a former investment banker who’s chairman of the entertainment authority. His target is to create six public entertainment options every weekend for Saudis. But the larger goal, he said, is “spreading happiness” in what has sometimes been a somber country.', 'The instigator of this attempt to reimagine the kingdom is the 31-year-old deputy crown prince. With his brash demeanor, he’s the opposite of the traditional Bedouin reserve of past Saudi leaders. Unlike so many Saudi princes, he wasn’t educated in the West, which may have preserved the raw combative energy that is part of his appeal for young Saudis.', 'The trick for Mohammed bin Salman is to maintain the alliance with the United States, without seeming to be America’s puppet. “We have been influenced by you in the U.S. a lot,” he said. “Not because anybody exerted pressure on us — if anyone puts pressure on us, we go the other way. But if you put a movie in the cinema and I watch it, I will be influenced.” Without this cultural nudge, he said, “we would have ended up like North Korea.” With the United States as a continuing ally, “undoubtedly, we’re going to merge more with the world.”', 'Mohammed bin Salman is careful when he talks about religious issues. So far, he has treated the religious authorities as allies against radicalism rather than cultural adversaries. He argues that extreme religious conservatism in Saudi Arabia is a relatively recent phenomenon, born in reaction to the 1979 Iranian revolution and the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Sunni radicals later that year.', '“I’m young. Seventy percent of our citizens are young,” he said. “We don’t want to waste our lives in this whirlpool that we were in the past 30 years. We want to end this epoch now. We want, as the Saudi people, to enjoy the coming days, and concentrate on developing our society and developing ourselves as individuals and families, while retaining our religion and customs. We will not continue to be in the post-’79 era,” he concluded. “That age is over.”', 'Read more from David Ignatius’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.', 'Read more on this issue:', 'David Ignatius: A 30-year-old Saudi prince could jump-start the kingdom — or drive it off a cliff', 'The Post’s View: The United States’ bloody alliance with Saudi Arabia', 'Dennis Ross: In Saudi Arabia, a revolution disguised as reform', 'Fareed Zakaria: Saudi Arabia: The devil we know']",0.66666666664

NASA Opportunity Rover Still Rolling (Video)]', 'The valley, which cuts through the crater rim from east to west, is of special interest to planetary scientists because it appears that some kind of fluid activity carved it out of the landscape billions of years ago. The rover’s exploration will help determine whether it was water, wind or a mix of flowing debris lubricated by water that did the carving, NASA officials\xa0said in a statement.', 'Once Opportunity arrives at Perseverance Valley, which is located less than four football fields’ distance from the rover’s current location, it will study the assortment of rock sizes and aim to determine what caused the valley’s erosion.', ""As it nears 11 years on Mars, NASA's Opportunity rover is showing signs of memory loss.

So, by driving Opportunity into this valley, perhaps more observational evidence of ancient flowing water on the Martian surface will be gathered, NASA officials said.', 'Before the rover embarked on the next chapter of its Red Planet odyssey, however, it snapped a color panoramic image (a mosaic stitched together from many separate photos captured by its mast-mounted panoramic camera) of a ridge that the rover team nicknamed “Rocheport,” providing a clue of what the rover will encounter on the road ahead. (NASA also posted\xa0a 3D view of the panorama\xa0to be seen through red and blue glasses.)', '“The degree of erosion at Rocheport is fascinating,” Arvidson said. “Grooves run perpendicular to the crest line. They may have been carved by water or ice or wind. We want to see as many features like this on the way to Perseverance Valley as we can, for comparison with what we find there.”', 'The very fact Opportunity is leaving Cape Tribulation is cause for celebration. During this segment of the rover’s exploration of Mars, Opportunity achieved some impressive milestones, but it also encountered a challenge that could have doomed the mission.', 'In 2015, Opportunity reached the marathon distance traveled on Mars since it landed in 2004. The location where it hit that 26.2-mile mark was dubbed “Marathon Valley” to commemorate the feat. But during that time, Opportunity\xa0suffered bouts of amnesia\xa0as its aging flash memory encountered errors. Indeed, the mission was designed to last only three months; more than a decade of continuous operations had taken their toll.

Politicians who portray themselves as anti-establishment appear to be energizing many voters. Those who support mainstream parties might decide to stay home. Populists such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the far left and Le Pen on the far right would benefit from a rise in abstentions among mainstream voters.', 'What if it comes down to the far left vs. the far right?

But as the far-left candidate, he might be unable to motivate enough people to vote for him instead of Le Pen. His views — he advocated for leaving NATO, for instance — might be\xa0considered too extreme by many voters.', 'What happens if Le Pen makes it to the second round?\xa0A Le Pen win\xa0today would make the second round a de facto referendum on\xa0the future of the E.U.

Sure. But it would represent a seismic shift in the NFL landscape. And it also would mean the Titans were likely not just in the playoffs but probably had advanced pretty far. Of the top five quarterbacks in\xa0ESPN's QBR ratings\xa0from last season, two—Brady and Ryan—went to the Super Bowl, Prescott went to the divisional round and Rodgers went to the NFC title game.

The chances of him suffering a catastrophic injury in consecutive seasons are slim (hopefully). It just rarely happens to quarterbacks.', ""Also of help is a weak AFC South, the worst division in the sport. The Texans will be monstrous on defense, but they don't have a decent quarterback. The Jaguars likely will be, again, the Jaguars. Andrew Luck is terrific but offered little clarity in recently discussing his timeline to return after undergoing surgery on his throwing shoulder in January. That leaves the Titans as the team best set up to take a dramatic step forward in the division."", ""It wouldn't require too much of a stretch, to be honest. They went from 3-13 in 2015 to nine wins last season and were tied with the Texans atop the division heading into Week 16 before Mariota shattered his leg and Houston got the playoff spot by virtue of a tiebreaker. As Geoffrey C. Arnold of The Oregonian outlined, Tennessee improved from 25th\xa0in rushing two seasons ago to third in 2016, which coincided with a boost in scoring and total offense from 28th and 30th, respectively, in 2015 to 14th\xa0and 11th last season."", 'What happened to the Titans was pretty simple: The offensive line played better and the running game improved, but those things got better because Mariota got better.

His improved play forced defenses to play the entirety of the Titans offense and not practically ignore Mariota as they did in 2015.', 'And if he improves as much as some around the league think, a move into the top five may only be a step on his way to something greater.', '\xa0 \xa0', 'Mike Freeman covers the\xa0NFL\xa0for Bleacher Report.

How Trudeau Is (Kind of) Legalizing Pot in Canada," Don't panic, illegal smokers.","['Canada is planning to legalize recreational marijuana, which would make it only the second nation to do so,\xa0after Uruguay. Beyond that, it gets complicated. The plans unveiled on April 13 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government were short on details about what the market might look like, and included onerous new penalties. Rather than celebrating the prospect of legalization in the not-so-distant future, Canada’s pot activists are complaining about the law-and-order campaign against pot use.', 'The proposed legislation, targeted to take effect by July 2018, would let anyone over 18 buy fresh or dried cannabis, cannabis oils, seeds and plants. Edible products like brownies will be legalized later. Adults can carry and share up to 30 grams in a public place at any time, and grow up to four plants in any residence. Minors won’t be prosecuted if found with under five grams.', 'Canada’s legalization push is being accompanied, somewhat paradoxically, by a crackdown on pot use and users. Selling products that mix cannabis with nicotine, caffeine or alcohol won’t be allowed (no pot-infused coffee pods like the ones that have debuted in some U.S. stores). Police will be allowed to do roadside alcohol tests without any evidence of impairment -- likely a violation of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, lawyers warn -- and collect “oral fluid samples” to test for marijuana. Providing marijuana to someone under 18 could lead to a jail sentence of up to 14 years.', 'It is when you consider this: Under Canadian law, the same maximum 14-year sentence applies to crimes such as sexually assaulting a child, severely assaulting a police officer, creating child pornography, human trafficking and certain terrorism offenses.', 'That’ll be left up to provinces to decide, which adds to the uncertainty. Medical marijuana is already sent by mail in Canada and, if provinces don’t set up retail sales, recreational pot will be sent by mail, too. (Provinces will also be allowed to enforce a higher minimum age for marijuana use.) The federal government hasn’t said how it will tax pot or if it will fix prices, as Uruguay, has done. Companies will be allowed to do some advertising and promotion, with restrictions, but all endorsements are barred -- sorry, Snoop Dogg.', 'Canada has 43 licensed medical marijuana producers, including prominent ones like Canopy Growth Corp., Aurora Cannabis Inc. and OrganiGram Holdings Inc. They surged in value in anticipation of the new market. Though shares fell in the days after the long-awaited announcement -- some executives had been cashing out -- these medical producers figure to have a head start.', 'Trudeau, 45, says he’s smoked pot, including since becoming a member of Parliament. His Liberal Party passed a motion before the last election calling for legalization, accompanied by “strict penalties” for trafficking, export and impaired driving. The party also called for amnesty for those convicted until now.', 'That’s what Canada’s pot activists are asking. Not only has Trudeau not pursued amnesty, he’s publicly encouraging police to keep arresting people while legalization is on the legislative table.', 'He probably added the strict laws to calm fears from groups that worry legalization will unleash mayhem on roads. Politics is also playing a role. Trudeau’s chief rivals in the Conservative Party largely oppose legalization, and unleashing law enforcement might be how Trudeau’s centrist government shores up its right flank.', 'Trudeau’s proposal, contained in two bills, is expected to pass the House of Commons but could face delays in the Senate; its unelected members serve until age 75 and have been more unpredictable recently. There are also warnings the plan violates both domestic and international law, and some portions could therefore eventually be struck down in court. Each of Canada’s 10 provinces will have to set up its own system, with\xa0potentially varying legal ages of purchase and retail rules. Cities need their own rules, too. The federal government will work to develop regulations around things like packaging, and unveil how it plans to tax sales. All this could take a while.', 'That’s hard to say -- the government has described it as an aspiration. Also unclear is whether pot might be sold in stores, or by mail, or both, and whether it’s taxed heavily. In the interim, producers continue to face strict, costly rules on security without clarity on when and how they will sell and market their product.', 'While Canada is legalizing from the top down, leaving details to provinces, the U.S. push is bottom-up. Eight U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana use, though White House press secretary Sean Spicer warns there could be stepped-up enforcement of federal law banning it. Due to the legal uncertainty, American pot investors looking to list companies or otherwise raise funds have made Canada their home base. But don’t expect much in the way of cross-border pot trade -- Canada’s new rules mostly ban marijuana exports and imports, except for medical or scientific purposes.']",0.66666666664

The city breathes with the rise and fall of its tide, and for centuries the Thames has posed patiently for tourist drawings, etchings and photos. But what of London’s other rivers, the capital’s unseen waterways? Twenty-one tributaries flow to the Thames within the spread of Greater London, and that is just counting the main branches. Once tributaries, and tributaries of tributaries, are included the total moves beyond numbers into the realms of conjecture.', 'Many of these rivers flow quietly above ground, in plain sight but generally unnoticed beyond their neighbourhoods. Their enticing names echo London’s rural past – the Crane, the Darent, the Mutton Brook, the Pool River – or carry a whiff of the exotic – the Ching, the Moselle, the Quaggy, the Silk Stream. These rivers go about their business forgotten in the background, but many inner London waterways have been deliberately hidden. London’s landscape was shaped by the hills and valleys these rivers created, but as the city grew they began to get in the way and were buried, bit by bit, under layers of streets and houses.', 'London once needed all the rivers it could get: for drinking water, for harbours and wharves, for mills, for tanneries, and for sluicing away waste. The rivers were London’s sewage system long before any system was conceived, but even tiny medieval London was too much for any stream to cope with. The Walbrook, flowing through the heart of the City of London, was mostly paved over in the 1460s; it was considered a filthy nuisance choked with refuse. London’s origins are deep in the Walbrook, the river around which the Romans founded the city. The debris dug from the river – hoes and ploughshares, chisels and saws, scalpels and spatulas, the heads of forgotten gods and a collection of 48 human skulls tell the earliest London tales.', 'As London began to grow at the end of the 18th century, and then to mushroom beyond reason during the 19th century, the rivers became a big problem. Floods, filth, stench and disease put off Georgian and Victorian house-buyers. In Mayfair, the Tyburn was tucked away under mews. In West Norwood, the Effra was buried deep under grids of new Victorian villas.', 'The Fleet was legendarily filthy. Redesigned as a Venetian-style canal by Christopher Wren after the Fire of London, it was quickly overtaken by grim reality. Jonathan Swift, in 1710, wrote about the Fleet filled with “the sweepings from butchers’ stalls, dung, guts and blood.” A few years later Alexander Pope described how “Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams / Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to the Thames.” It is no surprise then that the lower Fleet was culverted in huge storm sewer tunnels where it has remained ever since. Yet before the river became more trouble than it was worth, it was a crucial route in as well as out. Everything from Welsh cheese to coals from Newcastle arrived at the Fleet wharves, and even the stones for Old St. Paul’s Cathedral were unloaded here.', 'The rivers may be hidden but they are far from gone. It is very hard to stop a river from flowing, so they have merely been diverted into the sewer system, often as part of Joseph Bazalgette’s monumental tunnelling programme during the 1860s and 1870s. They can still be seen if you know where to look, flowing through culverts and under gratings. Sometimes they are hidden in plain sight. The Hampstead and Highgate Ponds are former reservoirs created by damming two streams that form the Fleet. Regent’s Park Lake was originally fed by the Tyburn, while the Serpentine was landscaped from the Westbourne in 1731 for the benefit of George II’s consort, Queen Caroline. Unfortunately the sewage problem eventually rendered both rivers unsuitable for ornamental ponds, and they were diverted away.', 'They also shaped London’s hills and valleys, a landscape layered over but still visible. Mysteriously steep roads, such as Pentonville Rise, make sense when seen as the sides of the Fleet Valley. The sharp dip as Piccadilly passes Green Park shows us where the Tyburn once crossed the road. The Oval is oval because it was built into a bend in the Effra. Holborn Viaduct is a bridge with no river built on the site of an ancient Fleet crossing. From the viaduct the valley of the Fleet stretches away below, wide and deep, now occupied by Farringdon Street.', 'Names also contain clues obvious only in retrospect. Kilburn is named after the upper reaches of the Westbourne, also responsible for Bayswater, and once crossed by the Knight’s Bridge. Wandsworth has its very own river, the Wandle. Peckham Rye means “village by the River Peck”. Streets retain the river names: Effra Road and Westbourne Green, or just simply Neckinger and Walbrook.', 'Lost rivers really are everywhere, even in the places Londoners think they know intimately. The Tyburn runs directly beneath Buckingham Palace. The Walbrook is probably the most direct route into the Bank of England, running in a tunnel under its vaults. The Earl’s Sluice curves its way past Millwall football ground. The lost rivers link the familiar – the Royal Parks, Mayfair, the City, the South Bank – to places few visit – the back streets of Camberwell, Croydon, Earlsfield, Elephant and Castle, Gospel Oak, Kentish Town, Mitcham, Swiss Cottage, and West Norwood to name but a few.', 'London’s rivers are invisible threads, binding London together under the surface while the city roars above. They were here long before people or buildings arrived. They are a hidden system for cutting through the layers on which London stands, and revealing the many places London used to be.', ""Tom Bolton\xa0is a researcher and author, whose book\xa0London's Lost Rivers: A Walker's Guide\xa0reveals the unseen rivers that flow through London.\xa0"", '6 Telegraph expert rating', '8 Telegraph expert rating', '9 Telegraph expert rating']",0.3333333333

But a university official\xa0raised concerns about that name, citing cultural appropriation, according to emails provided to The Washington Post. The back-and-forth led to a delay, Cimino said.', 'Ultimately, “Bad(minton) and Boujee,” which was supposed to be held later this month,\xa0was canceled.', '“Throughout our exchanges, the university took very long to get back to us, and our current email has been sitting for over a week without a response,” the fraternity wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday, announcing its decision. “As such, we have not had time to fundraise or organize the event with its verification in limbo and subsequently decided we had to cancel it.”', '“Bad and Boujee” — which begins “Raindrop … Drop-top … Smokin’ on cookie in the hot box …” — was released by the Georgia rap trio Migos in 2016. It spawned online memes\xa0and became a chart-topping hit.', 'After developing the idea for the badminton tournament, the fraternity submitted a request to reserve the area on campus where it was planning to hold the event, according to Cimino. But, Cimino said, a few days after the event was announced, Cimino got a note from a university official. Colin Gerker, assistant director of fraternity and sorority life. Gerker sent an email on March 30, saying he suspected “that this event name will be criticized for the use of ‘boujee.’ ”', '“I know it’s a colloquial term and is popular via Migos, but we have had groups get reamed for appropriating culture before related to situations like this,” he wrote.', '“Boujee” is an abbreviated slang term that comes from the word\xa0“bourgeois.”', '“Honestly, I just\xa0thought it was classic AU,” said Cimino,\xa0when asked about his reaction to the email.

Democrat Narrowly Misses Outright Win in Georgia House Race ," Political intrigue is nothing new, but this is the first time it has given real force to a political query.","['ROSWELL, Ga. — Jon Ossoff, a Democrat making his first bid for elective office, narrowly missed winning a heavily conservative House district in Georgia outright on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press. It threw a scare into Republicans in a special congressional election that was seen as an early referendum on President Trump. Mr. Ossoff fell just short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat, at 48.3 percent as of 1:26 a.m., and he will face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote-getter, in a June runoff.', 'A documentary filmmaker and former congressional staff member, Mr. Ossoff, 30, had hoped to avert a runoff in the Sixth District, a Republican-dominated section of the Atlanta suburbs that had been represented by Tom Price, who is now Mr. Trump’s health and human services secretary. But despite his financial advantage — Mr. Ossoff had raised $8.3 million, more than quadruple that of the next closest candidate — and a highly energized liberal base, a majority was just out of reach in a district that has not sent a Democrat to Congress since the Carter administration.', 'Mr. Ossoff appeared at his party just before midnight and said the outcome of the vote may not be known “for some time.”', '“But let me tell you this — there is no doubt that this is already a victory for the ages,” he said. “That no matter what the outcome is tonight, whether we take it all or whether we fight on, we have defied the odds. We have shattered expectations. We are changing the world.”', 'Mr. Ossoff’s strong showing will ensure that national Democrats continue to compete here and will increase pressure on the party to contest a special House election next month in Montana that it has so far ignored. Combined with Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in a special House election in Kansas last week, the Georgia result will be an immediate boon to Democratic groups, lifting their fund-raising and bolstering candidate recruitment efforts, while sobering Republicans who are assessing whether to run in Mr. Trump’s first midterm election. Already, Republican candidates and outside groups have had to spend over $7 million against Democrats in a series of deeply conservative districts.', 'Early Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump, who had posted a number of Twitter messages on the contest in the last few days, claimed a victory for Republicans before the race was called.', 'Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG ""R"" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!', 'As Mr. Ossoff faces Ms. Handel in a head-to-head race on June 20, it is unclear whether he will be able to sustain the success he enjoyed on Tuesday, in an 18-person field. Ms. Handel, who received 19.7 percent of the vote, as of 1:27 a.m. on Wednesday, is a former Georgia secretary of state and is viewed as an establishment-friendly Republican. While she has struggled in her two previous campaigns, losing primaries for governor and senator, she will receive the full support of a party that dominates Georgia politics, as well as nearly unlimited resources from Washington Republicans, in the runoff.', 'Ms. Handel, 55, has portrayed herself as a Trump supporter, though she was less fervent in her support for him than the other Republican candidates in the race, who adopted Mr. Trump’s catchphrases and style in an attempt to stand out.', 'The intense Republican competition and liberal enthusiasm lifted Democratic hopes that they could snatch a surprise victory.', '“We are certainly going for an outright win here today,” Mr. Ossoff told CNN on Tuesday before the polls closed.', 'Here’s how we analyzed Georgia’s special election through about 11 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, which the Democrat Jon Ossoff cast as a referendum on President Trump.', 'Much as they did in last week’s race in Kansas, Democrats initially got their hopes up after promising early-vote returns were posted soon after polls closed. But as the Election Day results trickled in, it became clear that those early and absentee ballots, reflecting their fired-up base, would not be sufficient to match the Republicans’ structural advantage in the district.', 'On Tuesday night, hundreds of Ossoff supporters crammed into a ballroom at a Crowne Plaza hotel. Cries of delight erupted as early returns flashed on big television screens. But many attendees were cautiously optimistic, with an emphasis on caution.', 'Janice Owens, 60, a project manager who had been knocking on doors and making calls for Mr. Ossoff, said she and others would not feel the effort was wasted if Mr. Ossoff failed to avert a runoff.', '“I don’t think anybody thinks it’s for naught,” she said. “Because we’re not giving up.” If anything, the Ossoff campaign showed how Democrats had been successful, even in this Republican-friendly chunk of suburbia, in converting an enthusiastic but inchoate anti-Trump movement into a real political force.', 'Ms. Handel took the stage at a lightly attended victory party of her own shortly after 11 p.m. to claim her spot in the runoff — and urge Republicans to unify to stop Democrats’ effort to “steal a seat.”', 'This year, there will be five special House elections, four to fill vacancies left by members of the Trump administration.', 'Ms. Handel, battling a few bouts of feedback from a microphone, invoked the “great legacy” of a district that she noted has produced the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator Johnny Isakson and Mr. Price.', 'But she made no mention of Mr. Trump. Ms. Handel dismissed her opponent as a “young man” beholden to national liberals and vowed to “kick a little Ossoff.”', 'The contest here effectively represented the first performance review at the ballot box for Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress among the sort of upscale voters who were left without a political home last fall. Mr. Price’s former district is the most highly educated Republican-controlled district in the country. And while the president won here in Atlanta’s booming northern suburbs, he did so by just a single point four years after Mitt Romney romped to a 23-point victory.', 'For all of the attention lavished on the working class — Rust Belt voters who flocked to Mr. Trump’s campaign — voters who have flourished in the 21st-century economy will prove more crucial when it comes to the fight for control of Congress next year. If Democrats are to have a chance at recapturing the House, they will have to win over the dominant constituency here: suburbanites who only grudgingly cast a presidential ballot in November and have no deep affinity for either Mr. Trump or the Democrats.', 'None of the major Republican contenders pointedly distanced themselves from the president — they did not dare anger the partisans most likely to vote in a spring special election — but most of them did not make him central to their appeals, either.', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', 'With Republican Party officials worried that Democratic enthusiasm might be enough for Mr. Ossoff to get more than 50 percent of the vote and win the seat outright, though, Mr. Trump eventually did weigh in on the contest. He recorded a robocall delivered Monday to Republican voters in the district, warning that Mr. Ossoff would “raise your taxes, destroy your health care and flood our country with illegal immigrants.” And he posted on Twitter a series of messages similarly criticizing Mr. Ossoff while prodding Republicans to “force runoff.”', 'Mr. Ossoff walked a careful line when it came to Mr. Trump. He opened his bid with donor-tailored appeals to “Make Trump Furious,” and continued similar targeted advertising throughout his campaign. But he also sought to cast himself as a consensus-oriented moderate focused on the district, dismissing Mr. Trump’s late intervention as so much noise from Washington.', 'Sensing an opportunity to deliver an early blow to Mr. Trump, and nudged ahead by an animated base hungry to register its fury, Democrats aggressively competed to win outright on Tuesday and avert a more directly partisan runoff. In addition to Mr. Ossoff’s astounding $8.3 million haul through the end of March, the House Democratic campaign arm poured money and staff into the district.', 'Republicans were as fractured as Democrats were unified, with political veterans such as Ms. Handel on the ballot as well as newcomers who saw an opportunity at a moment when the party seemed to be in flux.', 'The Republican field was divided over the failed bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it treated the issue delicately in what amounted to a concession that what was once the safest stance in a Republican primary — demanding full repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law — was not so clear-cut any longer.', 'In an illustration of how nationalized the race became, 95 percent of Mr. Ossoff’s fund-raising haul was from out of state, and nearly as much was from outside the district, where the candidate himself does not reside (though he grew up there).', 'Republicans blistered him on this score and much else, a kitchen-sink campaign that totaled $5 million yet also stirred muttering within the party about why there had not been a more coherent approach to a district they knew would be competitive, given Mr. Trump’s weakness here. But the unrelenting Republican assault eventually paid off, raising Mr. Ossoff’s negative ratings and nudging conservative voters to show up for an unusual spring election.']",0.0

Meet the Former Pro Surfer Who Has Helped 7 Million People Get Clean Water, The final issue of Time is out this thingy... the very last and much more,"['Jon Rose was on the water when his life changed.\xa0The former pro surfer was on his way to Bali by boat. After encountering some rough water, the captain docked Rose and his friends in Padang, Indonesia. They had a reservation at a hotel, but the captain insisted they stay on the boat for the night. The next day, Sept. 30, 2009, they felt the rumble—the start of the Sumatra earthquakes.', ""At that time, Rose had been asking big questions about his life and his identity. Growing up in Laguna Beach, California, he'd been a surfer since the age of nine. At 31 and recently retired, he didn't quite know who he was without the waves—or the lifestyle that came along with his success. His marriage was ending and he was close to foreclosing on his home. He agreed to go on the trip only when he came up with the idea to combine surfing with philanthropy—he'd hit the water and then give away clean water to people who needed it."", 'Then he walked ashore in Indonesia and saw the earthquake destroyed the hotel he had planned to stay in. He saw a city crumbled. He saw bodies. He felt helpless.\xa0And then he remembered the water filters he\'d brought.\xa0He found some old gasoline buckets and an emergency relief tent, and he set up the filters so medical workers could clean the wounds of victims.\xa0""The earthquake in Sumatra was the divine intervention in my life,"" Rose says. ""I came home. I got a divorce. I saw the path forward in my life.""', ""Just three-and-a-half months later, on Jan. 12, 2010, an earthquake struck Haiti. A friend called Rose and asked if what he did in Indonesia would be replicable. Rose flew to Haiti the next day, planning to stay for two weeks.\xa0He didn't leave for two years."", ""He spent his days distributing water filters and instructing people how to use them. He sometimes didn't shower for months. He slept in a tent. He ate cold ravioli and meals ready to eat (MREs). It wasn't his previous pro surfer lifestyle, but for the first time since his retirement, Rose felt he was living the life he was meant to lead."", 'Across the globe, nearly 700 million people—about one in 10—lack access to clean drinking water. Instead, they are forced to drink every day from dirty sources, collecting water from lakes and puddles that they sometimes share with animals. In the developing world, the work of collecting water falls almost exclusively to women and girls, who often have to drop out of school to help provide for their families.', '""It\'s a huge problem,"" says Christoph Gorder, the president of charity: water, the largest water-only nonprofit in the United States. ""It\'s one of the great problems in our world today. But the good news is, it\'s totally solvable. Since 1990, 2.6 billion people have gotten access to clean water. We can bring this to everybody.""', ""In the nearly eight years since his experience in Indonesia, Rose's organization, Waves for Water, has helped more than 7 million people gain access to clean drinking water. Along the way, it has helped redefine the rules for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Rose likens the way his group works less to a traditional charity and more to a drug cartel."", '""Well you have the supply,"" he jokes, ""those are the filters. Then the smugglers, the people like me who bring the filters into a country—sometimes without declaring them. Then we have distributors within each country who bring the water to people from city to city and neighborhood to neighborhood.""', ""Waves for Water's programs have touched people in 27 countries, but its active and recurring work focuses on 17 countries, primarily in Southeast Asia. Rose and his team raise money from corporate sponsorships to provide both sustainable water solutions—like wells and biosand filters—and disaster relief in the form of filters that are easy to transport and set up and can help provide clean water to communities affected by earthquakes and other calamities."", 'Rose, who recently gave up the lease to an apartment he had in New York City and sold a house in California, travels internationally as often as three weeks a month to monitor water projects and to implement new systems. Although Waves for Water was founded as a one-man passion project, it now employs about 40 people around the world. Rose has had to learn not only how to run a nonprofit, but also how to manage people.', 'A photo posted by J O N 🔹 R O S E (@jon_rose)', ""Caitlan Rowe, Waves for Water's global operations director, is one of the people Rose pulled into his orbit. In 2014, she had what she calls a cushy corporate job at Hurley in California when Rose invited her to bring clean water to favelas in Brazil. The trip for her was akin to what Rose had felt in Haiti.\xa0"", '""A lot of people—and I was one of them for a while—say, \'I wish I could do that kind of work. I wish I could help people,\'"" she says. ""Jon just did it. The dedication that takes, to put your life on hold, it\'s attainable, but you have to put your ass in gear and you have to be prepared to give yourself away.""', ""Gorder doesn't know Rose personally, but he's inspired anew each time he sees someone learn about the world water crisis and decide to take action."", '""The moral of the story is: Anybody can make a difference,"" he says. ""There are a lot of ways people can help. You can start an organization or donate to one or raise money with a lemonade stand in your front yard with your kids. There are a million ways to help.

"Labour is in deep trouble, but it’s our only defence against a Tory landslide"," Guest letters from leading British media, reproduced here with permission.","['Theresa May can never be trusted on anything she says ever again. She is a patently dishonest politician who cannot keep her word, because for her, partisan self-interest is more important. Her position was clear. A few weeks ago, May’s spokesperson said: “There isn’t going to be one. It isn’t going to happen. There is not going to be a general election.”', 'May claims that her U-turn on a snap general election was driven by the threat of Brexit being obstructed by parliament. This is a lie. There is no obstruction. To the chagrin of many ardent remainers, Labour voted through article 50 and emphasised it would respect the will of the British people.', 'May was the remainer who reinvented herself as a hard Brexiteer, again for partisan self-interest. May was the leader who allowed her chancellor to break a key Tory election pledge on national insurance, only to U-turn when the betrayal became impossible to argue for because of her small majority.', 'She said that now wasn’t the time for a Scottish independence referendum because of the instability it would cause, and then plumps for an unnecessary general election. She announced a pause on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and then – under pressure from China’s regime – U-turned.', 'You Can’t Trust May is just one possible approach for Labour as election-weary voters ask why they have been asked to yet again march to polling stations. But, look. Labour’s current polling is very, very bad indeed: you can’t try to climb a mountain if you are deluded about how high it is. The threat of an early election these past few months should have haunted every moment, for Labour’s left and its trade union allies: those of us who wanted a Labour party that was firmly rooted on the left on the economy, tax and public services, and which could inspire enough people to vote for it.', 'A man who stood only out of a sense of duty, to put policies on the agenda, and who certainly had no ambition to be leader, will now take Labour into a general election, against all his original expectations. My suggestion that Corbyn stand down in favour of another candidate was driven by a desire to save his policies – which, as the polling shows, are very popular indeed – from being buried in the rubble of a terrible election defeat. They made the decision last June and since – yes, in accordance with the majority of Corbyn’s supporters – not to do so. So now what we must do is unite and do our very best to prevent a Tory landslide that would be calamitous for the country.', 'This referendum is about Brexit above all else. Labour has understandably agonised over losing the minority of its voters who plumped for leave, not least in its northern heartlands and among older voters who are more motivated to turn out to cast their ballots. It must now make a pitch, too, for despondent remainers.', 'Yes, that means reassuring leave voters that they will respect the referendum result. But the party must pitch for the 48% who voted remain. May has nothing but contempt for them. They are being not just ignored, but demonised. They are being denied a say over the future of our country. Only Labour can represent you, and the party will do so with every fibre of its being.', 'Labour will stay in the single market and the customs union. That must be the argument. The party must say: we will defend the rights and benefits that we currently have, which benefit the majority of the country. That will be the basis of any Brexit deal. If the Tories win an immense majority, a ruinous hard Brexit could beckon. If you want to put jobs, the economy and living standards first, you must vote Labour to stop a landslide victory that could turn Britain into a barren tax haven run in the interests of billionaires. Wages are starting to fall: no doubt just one reason why this election was called. Rather than going back to diagnosing a “cost of living crisis”, Labour must set out how it will cure it.', 'Some will be tempted to vote for the Lib Dems again. Their years of propping up a Tory government – which has led Britain to this calamitous moment – must be emphasised. Tim Farron is on record committing his party once again to a coalition with the Conservatives. He even sided with Donald Trump as soon as he started firing missiles. There is no party so demonstrably dishonest in modern British political history. In any case, our electoral system means that Lib Dem chances of winning a considerable number of seats to champion the remain cause are minimal.', 'As has been noted, Labour’s recent policies are indeed electorally very popular. You don’t win elections, though, with policies that – taken individually – have high levels of support, as Ed Miliband discovered. There has to be a vision to bring them together. If you don’t define what you are for, you will be defined by your opponents, already the critical problem afflicting Labour’s leadership. You need a sunny, optimistic vision, not a miserable shaking of the stick at everything that’s wrong.', 'Investing in the Future, for example. Labour privately briefs that the theme of its recent policies is standing up for the 99% and standing up to the 1%. That has to be conveyed in a short, snappy phrase – like Long Term Economic Plan did for the Tories. Above all else: find a vision and stick to it, relentlessly. Every policy you announce must then slip into that frame: so rather than being another good idea thrown into the ether, it emphasises to the electorate what you are about.', 'And here’s a message for Labour’s immense grassroots army. This is your moment. No excuses: every single one must take to the streets, knocking on doors every possible night that you can, getting the message across, ensuring that on election day there’s the biggest get out the vote operation in the history of British democracy. That may make a sizeable difference in terms of how many seats are won or lost. Voting in a leadership election was not enough, or even close. Go out and fight with everything you have.', 'There is no point being dishonest here. The Tories have called this election for naked partisan interest: it is cynical and dishonest, but from their own perspective, the logic is self-evident. Everything will now be thrown at Labour and its leadership: and the party starts from a very low base indeed. Corbyn decided to stay, and – with the national platform he will now have – he and his team must prove they can put forward an inspiring and coherent vision. Expose a dishonest Theresa; fight for a Brexit deal that puts jobs, the economy and living standards first; and stand for a Britain run in the interests of the majority, not the elites. Save the postmortem for whatever happens. Now it’s the time to fight.']",0.26666666666

Let’s take a journey inside the world of forensic psychiatry, which has been part of my day-to-day work for two decades.', 'When a man shows no empathy for another man and extinguishes his life, out of the blue, he is using that horrific drama as a metaphor for his own psychological and spiritual death.

There is always a why.', 'When Stephens looked into the eyes of a stranger and fired the shot that left a lifeless body behind, he was looking into his own eyes — because he had lost himself, completely. For Stephens, the world felt like a place utterly devoid of hope and of love. Nonsensical. Suffocating. Unforgiving. Barren. Desolate.', 'It is a terrible irony that Stephens would post his act of taking an anonymous man’s life on Facebook, which encourages people to use technology to bury their true characters and turn their life stories into technologically happy-go-lucky, empty, fake dramas. It is the ideal forum for posting the pixelated dissolution of a human life.', 'How can I know all this, without having met Stephens? Because he showed us.

New Asteroid Study Suggests Hollywood Is Wrong About Ocean Impacts," The effects of an anti-social space rock in a space movie may instead be reduced to a mirage, a new graduate-level work has revealed, and may clarify confusion over whether a space object can create tsunamis from its impact - an issue","[""A new study suggests that most of the energy from an asteroid's impact is spent vaporizing water and forming a crater, not making waves. Getty Images/Science Photo Library RM"", ""When an asteroid hits the middle of the ocean in Hollywood movies, it creates devastating waves that wipe out coastal cities. But new simulations reveal that real asteroids don't make such a splash. That's because the crash releases most of its energy hurling water up into the atmosphere, and very little on making waves."", '""The folklore has been that tsunamis from impactors will be the danger,"" Galen Gisler, who studies the physics of geological processes at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference last month in The Woodlands, Texas. (Gisler also presented the work at the American Geophysical Union\'s fall meeting in December 2016.) He ran 3D simulations that modeled wave formation from falling rocks of various sizes, as shown in this video, and found that the waves formed by smaller asteroids resemble landslide tsunamis on Earth.', '""The splash wave can be very dangerous — out to tens of kilometers — but beyond that, they fall away more sharply,"" he said.', ""Earth doesn't drift alone in its orbit. Hundreds of thousands of near-Earth objects (NEOs) dance near its path, most of them rocky material born from ancient asteroid collisions. Once every 10,000 years or so, objects larger than 328 feet (100 meters) are expected to crash into the planet, with potentially devastating effects, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). With approximately 70 percent of Earth's surface covered with water, the oceans are the most likely landing spots for incoming asteroids."", 'Asked by NASA to calculate the smallest asteroids that should generate concern, Gisler ran 3D simulations to study the possible effects from an ocean splashdown. Such studies are time-intensive because they require modeling millions of particles, Gisler said; the 11 simulations he ran took him several months. He focused on asteroids with diameters under a third of a mile (500 meters).', 'Such detailed models are necessary to study the possible effects of the asymmetries that arise from an impact, he said. While asteroids can drop straight down into the ocean, they are far more likely to approach the water at an angle. The resulting impact will push more water in front of it than behind, and Gisler wanted to understand how this would affect any wave formation, like a potential tsunami.', 'It turns out asteroids are terrible at making waves. Gisler found that most of the energy (80 percent) from an impact is spent vaporizing water and forming a crater. The remaining 20 percent throws most of the liquid water up into the atmosphere, where it has the potential to affect weather patterns, he said. He estimated that only a tenth of 1 percent of the kinetic energy from an impact is spent forming waves. Those waves can still be massive, but they break up quickly.', ""Gisler found that asteroids approximately 460 feet (140 meters) in size and larger are most likely to cause significant problems. Today, NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies is working to identify 90 percent of the NEOs this size and larger, according to JPL; so far, they've spotted just over half of the estimated population."", 'If the asteroid impact is within 60 miles (100 km) or so of the shore, it can dramatically impact the coast, Gisler said. Larger objects, around 980 feet (300 meters), can create hurricane-force winds and shock waves in the air, as well as localized waves. But if the asteroid splashes down farther from the coast, the massive waves it forms quickly break in the open ocean.', '""It\'s very ineffective at actually producing a wave,"" Gisler said. ""The waves don\'t propagate very well.""', ""In fact, the effect is similar to waves produced by landslides around fjords in Norway and Iceland, he said. When material slides down the mountains and into these long, narrow inlets, they can create massive waves that have a large local effect but don't spread very far. In 1934, one such avalanche dropped enough rock to form waves 203 feet (62 meters) high, destroying several inhabited villages. While these landslides can be devastating for those near them, they pose little danger for those some distance away, Gisler said."", 'Thus, asteroid impact near the shore can wreak havoc, but the limited reach of those farther out in the ocean should cause far less concern.', '""If you\'re more than 100 kilometers from a shoreline, I would be tempted to say let the thing drop and study it,"" Gisler said.', 'Follow Nola Taylor Redd at @NolaTRedd, Facebook, or Google+.

Five myths about the cross," The Christian kiss and the biblical claim to have hung He, alone... are two of the main images that appear generally to link this deeply Christian story - or the religious event in which He was killed and then resurrected - to the traditional religious event that","['Christians worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus in Good Friday worship services, followed by celebration of his resurrection on Easter Sunday. But as often as the cross appears in Christian artwork and Western culture at large, misunderstandings and myths persist as to its history, origins and image. Here are five of the most stubborn misconceptions about Christianity’s most prominent symbol.', 'The iconic image of the Christian cross tends to feature a central vertical beam transected by a perpendicular beam about a third of the way down. This version of the cross is visible everywhere from emoji (which include both the two-beam Latin cross and the Orthodox cross, also known as the Suppedaneum cross, which has another bar near the bottom) to roadside memorials and, of course, church steeples.', 'But the actual crosses Romans used for executions probably took a different shape. The Greek and Latin words for “cross” — “stauros” and “crux” — do not necessarily describe what most people imagine as a cross. They refer to an upright stake upon which the condemned could be bound with hands above their heads. Most historians surmise that Jesus’ cross was more likely to have been T-shaped, with the vertical element notched to allow executioners to tie the victim to the crossbeam, then raise it and set it securely into the top. The Tau cross, named for its resemblance to the Greek letter, has been adopted over time by various Christian orders and sects, and it probably bears a stronger resemblance to the object upon which Jesus died on than those crosses more commonly depicted in Christian art.', 'Nearly every depiction of Jesus’ crucifixion — including masterpieces such as Sandro Botticelli’s “Mystic Crucifixion” and Diego Velázquez’s “Christ Crucified” — shows Him attached to the cross by nails through his palms and his feet.', 'The New Testament Gospels do not, however, directly say that Jesus was nailed to the cross. In fact, the only reference to such nails in the Gospels comes from the book of John and the story of doubting Thomas, who asks to see the marks of the nails in Jesus’ hands to confirm that he is really encountering the resurrected Christ (John 20:25). The tradition that Jesus was nailed to the cross may also derive from the passage in some translations of Psalm 21:16 that says, “They pierce my hands and feet.”', 'Yet, while some physical evidence for nailing the feet of crucifixion victims has been found by archaeologists, it would have been impossible to fix the condemned to a cross by nails alone, since the bones in the hands or wrists would not have supported the weight of the body. Rather, Romans would have at least also tied victims’ wrists to the crossbeam, or perhaps draped their arms over the back of the beam and secured them with ropes. Suffocation, rather than loss of blood, would be the cause of death.', 'The Gospel of John states that Jesus bore the cross by himself (John 19:17) to a hill called Golgotha, while the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke claim that authorities compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, to carry the cross for Him, presumably because the flogging He had received had left Him too weak to carry it. In either case, most depictions in Christian art (including renditions by Michelangelo, El Greco and Titian) show either man carrying a large, wooden cross with both a vertical and a horizontal beam.', 'Yet Romans generally had the upright beam already set up at the place of execution. To the extent that the condemned carried their own crosses, they would have been given only the horizontal piece, according to historians of ancient execution methods, including LaGrange College professor John Granger Cook.', '“For almost 1,000 years, the Christian church emphasized paradise, not Crucifixion,” two authors wrote in UU World magazine; in Slate, scholar Larry Hurtado claimed that “there was, in short, little to be gained in proclaiming a crucified saviour in that setting in which crucifixion was a grisly reality,” noting that “some early Christians tried to avoid reference to Jesus’ crucifixion.”', 'It is true that crosses were extremely rare symbols for Christians to use before the mid-4th century. Moreover, the first images of crosses portray them more as slender, gemmed staffs than as sturdy instruments of execution. Depictions of Jesus’ crucifixion were even more rare, not occurring with any regularity until the 6th century.', 'Yet there’s a reason this is surprising: Christian authors, poets and preachers wrote and spoke at great length about the significance and meaning of Jesus’ death on the cross. In the 2nd century, Christian thinker Justin Martyr wrote that “when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves,” emphasizing the humiliation and suffering of Jesus’ execution in a long dialogue with a non-Christian interlocutor. Tertullian, another prolific early Christian writer, also meditated at length on the crucifixion and its theological meaning.', 'While explaining the cross or crucifix’s absence from visual art may be difficult, timing its appearance with the rise of pilgrimage to the Holy Land and the sites of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection provides helpful clues. By the end of the 4th century, pilgrims were traveling to Jerusalem, where they could visit Golgotha and venerate a relic of the “true cross,” supposedly discovered by the Roman Empress Helena. Some even were privileged to receive a fragment of the holy wood. The image of the cross and the crucifix may be linked with pilgrims’ desire to re-create the scene in its historical setting, and the proliferation of cross images in the West may have to do with the cross-related souvenirs some pilgrims brought back.', 'This idea has some convinced followers. According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, various authorities “have linked the cross with nature worship and pagan sex rites.” The Church of the Great God, another denomination, likewise claims that “long before the coming of Christ, pagans used the cross as a religious symbol.”', 'Yet there is no evidence that Christians intentionally borrowed the cross from pre-Christian cultic symbols.', 'While it is true that many ancient religions used symbols similar to the cross (and that Egyptian Christians even adapted the ankh, a hieroglyph for “life”), two intersecting lines are a simple and very common figure. This makes it difficult to assert that early Christians consciously adopted a particular sign rather than inventing one specifically referring to their unique story of Jesus’ death upon a cross. While it is easy to see similarities in religious artwork from various traditions, it is also easy enough to locate distinctions among them.

When Being Your Boss's Go-To Person Turns Into A Nightmare (And How To Escape)," Job interviews are very taxing and unusual, but if you are lucky enough to be the go-to person at work, here are the four things you should know so you don't become the worst suited for the job:","[' (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock)', 'Being the go-to person for your boss carries prestige. You have access and exposure to someone at work with power and influence. But being the go-to person can turn into a nightmare. You start off by saying yes, demonstrate you can do everything and then all of a sudden find yourself being on call all the time, including nights and weekends. When your boss thinks you will do everything they ask, you might even find yourself being asked to do things you feel are unethical. Being the go-to person can ultimately take away your dignity and personal life.', 'You may find yourself in this difficult situation, and you want out. While you may feel out of control and powerless over the situation, being essential to your boss is what gives you power and leverage. Follow these four steps to get out unscathed and regain control and your self-respect:', '1. Have a time limit.', ""If you dislike being the go-to person at work, give yourself a time limit. Tell yourself that you will fill this role for a certain number of months until you are up for a promotion or the department is fully staffed. Being the go-to person can be exhausting, and there is only so much time that it works to you and your boss's advantage. Pick a date, and stick to it."", '2. Speak up about what you need.', 'Being the go-to person at work usually means that you are asked to complete projects outside of your job description and on top of your normal workload. When you are pulled to work on a pet project or fire drill, you may find it difficult to manage what you currently have on your plate. Tell your boss what is on your plate, and ask their advice on prioritizing the work. Sometimes, your manager will not know everything you are doing. It is your job to tell them.', '3. Delegate the work.', 'Just because your boss automatically thinks of you does not mean you have to do the work. Some managers do not care how the work is completed, just that it is completed under your supervision. If this is the case, do not hesitate to recruit interns or ask your peers if they would be willing to help. Be a leader, and delegate.', '4. Say no.', 'If all else fails, say no. If you are finding that being the go-to person has decreased your productivity level, the prestige of the position is no longer worth it. Whether the real or underlying reason for your decrease in productivity stems from your increasing resentment towards your boss or something else, keep that to yourself. If and when you politely tell your boss you are unable to do something, it is best to tie it to a business reason like productivity.', 'Being the yes person the entire time can cost you your worth and your organization if you start becoming less productive. Saying no takes guts, and sometimes you need to show your guts to maintain your self-respect.', ' ', 'Being the go-to person when you do not want to be can make you feel defeated and hopeless.

The initiative started in 1970 and is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. Federal law does not allow the money to pay for abortions, although it is not legal for a state to withhold funds from a provider applying for a grant solely because abortion is one of the services it offers.', 'Not all Planned Parenthood facilities or health clinics take Title X money, but some agencies use it to offset the cost of providing free or low-cost services to patients who would not otherwise be able to afford such care. about 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from Title X funds, according to the group.', 'Republicans tried to defund all of Planned Parenthood with the health care bill that failed to pass last month. The new law passed only after Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to break a tie vote.', 'Although the law does not go as far as some conservatives would like, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, said it is far from trivial.', '""Those who will be possibly impacted by this are often the sole providers of health care for these patients. They provide Pap smears and breast cancer screening and many other preventative services, and it is not so easy to find other providers to take up the slack if these providers don\'t receive the funding,"" he said. Training staffers to offer the kind of services and counseling these centers offer may be a real challenge in some areas of the country that rely on the clinics, he said.', 'Women can often obtain quicker and more convenient care from Planned Parenthood facilities than from other clinics. The majority offer same-day appointments, while only 42% of health departments do, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The average wait time for initial contraceptive care at Planned Parenthood is 1.2 days, but it is 4.1 days for health departments and 2.5 days at federally qualified health centers. And 78% of Planned Parenthood centers offer extended hours in which women could get care after work or on the weekend, whereas only 57% federally qualified health centers and just 18% of health departments do.', '""I\'m concerned without these preventative health services for women, it could increase unintended pregnancy and possibly increase the number of abortions women may need If they won\'t be able to access contraceptive methods that they want to use,"" Grossman said.', 'Planned Parenthood condemned the new law.', '""People are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access health care, and this bill is just the latest example. Planned Parenthood strongly opposes President Trump\'s willingness to undermine millions of women\'s access to birth control through the Title X family planning program,"" the organization said in a statement.', 'Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List, who attended Trump\'s closed-door signing ceremony, was pleased with the ""victory"" in giving states options.', '""We expect to see Congress continue its efforts to redirect additional taxpayer funding away from Planned Parenthood through pro-life health care reform after the spring recess,"" she said in a statement.', 'States that have found ways to restrict funding to these facilities, like Texas, have seen an impact on access to care overall, studies show.', ""In 2011, Texas cut its family planning budget from $111 million to $38 million. Afterward, one in every four clinics in the state closed or stopped providing family planning help altogether. The clinics that remained didn't often provide all forms of contraceptives such as IUDs, and many organizations that had provided free or low-cost care had to start charging, a study showed. Surveys found that women had less access to preventive care, and the childbirth rate for women covered by Medicaid went up."", 'The new law does not take the country to that point, the experts said. But some who study family planning services think it is a hint at the future, at least in states that have tried to impose restrictions.', '""It by itself is not the whole ballgame,"" said Joe Potter, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas who specializes in family planning research and author of the Texas studies. ""There are definitely some places that could be effected by this in a relatively important way.""']",0.26666666664

The Jewish holiday of Passover began Monday night, as many sat down to Seder meals to commemorate the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt. And Thursday marked Vaisakhi, which celebrates the forming of the Khalsa Panth ― the community of committed Sikhs.', 'As millions of people gathered for prayer and celebration, a string of heinous and offensive events reminded them of life’s fragility.\xa0', 'The following by no means constitutes a complete list of all the lives impacted by violence and bigotry this second full week of April. But these five events bring into sharp focus the difficult task of being a person of faith in the world today.', 'The bombs went off at two Coptic Christian churches in Egypt, killing more than 40 people and injuring dozens of others. It was Palm Sunday, one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi declared a three-month state of emergency in response.', 'Once again, Coptic Christians were in the news because they were being persecuted. Since the time of their split from the rest of the Christian community through the modern age, Coptic Christians have frequently been targeted\xa0with violence and aggression. It’s a sad reminder that in many parts of the world, one’s religion can be a liability.', 'On Monday, a Southern California man walked into an elementary school classroom and shot and killed his wife, who was a special education teacher. He also shot two students, killing one and injuring the other, before reportedly killing himself.\xa0', 'The gunman, Cedric Anderson, was later described as a husband and father who was active in his community, according to the Los Angeles Times. He was also a devout and vocal Christian,\xa0described as a pastor by at least one person. Najee Ali, a community activist who knew Anderson, told the Times that the shooter was a “deeply religious man.”', 'And yet he killed his estranged wife,\xa0Karen Elaine Smith. The shooting reminded Americans once again of the intimate horrors of domestic violence and how they play out in all too many deaths.', 'It also highlighted a double standard\xa0that exists in public commentary on Christians and members of non-Christian faiths. In the days following the shooting, commentators did not seek to blame all of Christianity or the Bible for the abuse of women ― a tolerance rarely shown when the perpetrators of deadly crimes are Muslim.\xa0', 'In ongoing efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, the U.S. mistakenly killed 18 members of allied Kurdish and Arab forces during an airstrike south of the Syrian city of Tabqa, the Pentagon said Thursday. The U.S.-led coalition forces had struck the position on Tuesday after another partner in the fight wrongly reported that the location was occupied by Islamic State militants.', '“The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position,” the Pentagon said. Those forces are attempting to encircle and ultimately capture the city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s main base of operations in Syria.', 'The desire to advance one’s faith plays a role in this conflict, as in so many others down through the centuries in the Middle East. And people in all those wars have died needlessly and cruelly.\xa0The latest incident reminds us of what Pope Francis and many others have pointed out ― that war is madness. As the pontiff said at a military cemetery in 2014, “War is irrational. Its only plan is to bring destruction. It seeks to grow by destroying.”', 'On the first full day of Passover, White House press secretary Sean Spicer resurrected common tropes of Holocaust denial when he falsely claimed that Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons.

Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.” Still later he apologized.', 'But the irony of his comments coming on Passover was not lost on the public. Many argued that Spicer’s “mistake” wasn’t a one-off gaffe but rather an echo of what Vox writer Jacob Gardenswartz described as “the Trump administration’s flirtation with Holocaust denial.”', 'The United States dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb\xa0for the first time in combat on Thursday, targeting Islamic State militants in Afghanistan. The strike was carried out “as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017,” according to a U.S. Central Command press release.\xa0', 'The military objective was to “get it over and done with and get the ISIS forces killed off,” said Barbara Starr, CNN’s Pentagon correspondent.', 'Many Christians pointed out that the attack was carried out on Holy or Maundy Thursday by a presidential administration filled with people who brandish their Christian identity to claim the moral high ground.

More than half of all Americans don’t—and we admit the two can be confusing. But we’re here to break it down. Both types of IRAs largely function the same way. You can only contribute $5,500 a year, and you can only withdraw money before you turn 59 and a half for things like buying a home or paying medical bills.', 'The big difference between a Roth and traditional IRA comes down to when the money you put in the account is taxed. In a traditional IRA, taxes are taken out when you withdraw your savings in retirement, and your annual contributions can lower your tax bill. You deposit your money into the account in monthly increments and watch it grow. Then, when you turn 59 and a half, you can withdraw your funds. The money is taxed after you take it out of the account.', 'With a Roth IRA, your money is taxed before you put it in your account instead of when you take it out. You still contribute in monthly increments, but you pay your taxes at your current tax rate. A Roth IRA is a great option if you expect to get raises over your career and retire in a higher tax bracket than you are in now.', 'Note that a Roth IRA has an income limit. If you earn more than $133,000 in 2017, you are ineligible for a Roth, so you’ll need to switch to a traditional IRA. Traditional IRAs aren’t restricted by income, but if you have an employer-sponsored retirement account like a 401(k), your ability to deduct your IRA contributions will start to be restricted at $61,000. Of course, if your employer matches your 401k contributions, you should invest there first. After all, that’s free money from your work.', 'The Roth IRA is definitely the more popular option. It had almost one and a half billion dollars more in contributions than traditional IRAs in 2013. But there are upsides to both retirement accounts. If you’re planning on retiring early and living frugally for many years, or if think your income will decrease, then a traditional IRA may be better. If you’re young and you expect to make more money later in life, a Roth IRA is your best bet.', '\xa0', 'Recently Viewed', ""So You've Maxed Out Your 401(k) -- Now What? -- The Motley Fool"", ""Here's what's going on with Chinese troop movements on North Korea's border"", 'United changes crew booking policy after passenger dragged off plane', ""Mika Brzezinski Says It's 'Unbelievable' Kellyanne Conway Works in the White House"", 'Lawyer: Dragged passenger will need reconstructive surgery', 'Ford CEO says car sales are still strong', 'The big geopolitical risk markets are missing', ""JP Morgan CEO: Donald Trump's Economic 'Sausage-Making' Is About to Start"", 'The Trump administration just rolled out big changes to Obamacare', ""'Infuriated' United pilots union slams cops for forcibly dragging passenger from plane"", 'Now That HHGregg Has Died, Best Buy, J.C.

The costs of such growth however are climbing and leaders are turning their attention this year to keeping the country’s swelling debt from destabilizing the financial system.', 'To better gauge China’s economy, here’s a few key themes to watch:', 'The rebound late last year was led almost entirely by the state as private investment in fixed assets slumped to the slowest pace on record. That spending has accelerated in the first two months of this year, signaling improved sentiment among those businesses, which are usually nimbler and more efficient than bloated state-owned conglomerates.', 'Monday’s report also will signal whether that revival is temporary or lasting. If private enterprises are confident enough to boost spending and expand more aggressively, policy makers would have less to fear from the rapid pace of debt accumulation and the economic expansion would be more sustainable and balanced.', 'Big-city home prices continued climbing after slumping at the end of last year. Authorities in about dozen cities have imposed tighter restrictions on purchases to deflate the bubble and help ease financial risk.', 'The latest data on completed property investment will show whether those curbs are slowing development, potentially weighing on economic growth.

Trump Makes His First Big Changes To Obamacare, BBC journalist Edefficacyt in the Middle: 'Re-igning claims s eau as an essential part ofObamacare',"['President Donald Trump’s administration has taken its first action to change the way the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act operate, aiming to shore them up for next year’s sign-up period.', 'The regulation published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Thursday is a response to insurers’ demands that federal authorities take steps to limit consumers’ ability to drop in and out of the insurance market. Such “gaming” of the system drives up costs for the carriers that must cover the consumers’\xa0claims.', 'The overall consequence of the new rules is that health insurance will be harder to buy in 2018, especially for people whose circumstances change during the year, enabling them to buy policies outside the annual sign-up period. The length of that sign-up period is also cut in half.', 'Other aspects of the regulation could make coverage less comprehensive, reduce the value of the tax credit subsidies that make premiums more affordable for low- and middle-income people, and allow insurers to offer plans with fewer medical providers in their networks.', 'These new policies are intended to make the exchanges more attractive to insurance companies next year, after more insurers pulled out of the program this year. Consumers may be forced to endure more hassles in order to keep insurers in the fold because without the insurers, there’s no coverage to buy.', 'But the new rules are arguably more notable for what they don’t address: subsidies for so-called\xa0cost-sharing reductions, which are paid to insurers covering the poorest enrollees. Trump has\xa0threatened to cut off\xa0those payments and send the markets into a tailspin in an unorthodox bid to pressure Democrats into supporting his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.', 'That’s why even the insurance industry ― which got a lot of what it asked for from the Trump administration in this regulation ― isn’t satisfied. The cost-sharing reductions are the industry’s most pressing concern, and Trump’s comments Wednesday that he might end them have\xa0heightened anxiety\xa0about what the exchanges will look like next year.', 'Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America’s Health Insurance Plans, praised the aspects of the regulation designed to ease regulatory burdens on insurers and impose stricter requirements on consumers.', 'But she said in a press release,\xa0“There is still too much instability and uncertainty in this market. Most urgently, health plans and the consumers they serve need to know that funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies will continue uninterrupted.”', '“Without funding, millions of Americans who buy their own plan will be harmed. Many plans will likely drop out of the market. Premiums will go up sharply ―\xa0nearly 20 percent ―\xa0across the market. Costs will go up for taxpayers. And doctors and hospitals will see even greater strains on their ability to care for people. We urge Congress and the administration to act now to guarantee funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies,” said Tavenner, who previously ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.', 'Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to reduce deductibles, copayments and other forms of cost-sharing for the lowest-income enrollees who use the exchanges, and the federal government is supposed to reimburse them for the lost money. In 2014, however,\xa0House Republicans sued then-President Barack Obama’s administration, arguing that the federal government was making those payments without authorization from Congress. A federal judge last year agreed with the GOP lawmakers, and the Obama administration appealed. When Trump became president, his administration became the defendant in the case. The two sides soon\xa0obtained delays from the appeals court while they decided how to proceed.', 'For now, the Trump administration has continued making those payments. Some House Republicans have expressed support for keeping the money flowing or even authorizing the spending, which would resolve the legal dispute.', 'But Trump told The Wall Street Journal\xa0this week that he believes a threat to the viability of the insurance marketplaces could be leverage to force Democrats to the negotiating table. Democratic leaders have forcefully rejected this gambit\xa0and demanded that money for the cost-sharing subsidies be included in a pending federal spending bill.', 'Absent clarity on the subsidies, insurance companies may be reluctant to participate in the exchanges next year or, at a minimum, may request very high rate increases in order to cover their losses if the payments don’t continue. This could destabilize the troubled market just as analysts like Standard & Poor’s believe it may be righting itself.', 'The ways in which the regulation, which is little-changed from a proposed draft published in February, benefits insurers might not be enough.', '“While [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]\xa0has taken steps to correct some of the current challenges in the marketplace, these changes likely are not significant enough to sway health plan decisions for the upcoming plan year,” Cara Kelly, vice president at Avalere Health, said in a press release. “Losing health plans from the exchanges is still a risk for 2018.”', 'What’s more, the changes the administration is making could actually reduce overall enrollment and discourage healthier, and thus less costly, consumers from signing up.', 'These are the key elements of the new regulation:\xa0', 'The open enrollment period will be half as long as originally proposed. Sign-ups for 2018 health coverage will run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, 2017, instead of going until Jan. 31, 2018. This could make it more difficult to spread the word about enrollment and provide assistance in signing up. The administration argues it will prevent people from waiting until they get sick to buy policies, something they have more time to do during a longer enrollment period.', 'Insurance companies will be allowed to refuse to sell policies to consumers who fail to make all their premium payments this year. The Obama administration gave consumers a 90-day grace period before they could be kicked out for nonpayment. It didn’t allow insurers to demand that money be paid back before enrolling people in coverage for the following year. The Trump rules permit, but don’t require, insurers to collect unpaid premiums.', 'People who need to obtain coverage after the open enrollment period will have to prove it. Certain life changes ― such as getting married, having a child or moving ― give consumers the opportunity to buy plans at any point during the year. Under Obama, these people merely had to attest to their new circumstances; Trump will require documentation. Insurers complained that people used these “special enrollment periods” to get coverage only when they needed medical care.', 'Insurers will be allowed to sell skimpier plans. The Affordable Care Act defines four “metal” levels of coverage ― bronze, silver, gold and platinum ― that offer increasingly more generous coverage that, in general, comes with increasingly higher premiums. Each metal level must cover a certain percentage of a typical person’s medical expenses. For instance, a silver plan has to cover at least 70 percent. Obama allowed plans to vary within their metal level by 2 percentage points in either direction. Trump will give them more leeway. A silver plan could cover between 66 percent and 72 percent of medical costs.\xa0This has a side effect of potentially lowering the value of the tax credit subsidies for premiums, because they’re based in part on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each geographic area. If that benchmark silver plan covers only 66 percent of medical expenses, it will have a lower price, and that lower price will lead to smaller subsidies for all policies in that locale.', 'Insurers will be allowed to include fewer “essential community providers” in their networks. Narrow network plans are a key way for insurers to keep costs down by excluding the most expensive providers. Obama required them to include at least 30 percent of area health providers that care for “medically underserved” and poor patients. Trump will reduce that threshold to 20 percent and leave it to states or private accrediting entities to determine whether an insurance policy has enough providers in its network.', 'Share this slide:']",0.26666666664

The death of diesel: has the one-time wonder fuel become the new asbestos?," The world's biggest car firm, Theophiles (who are also one of the world's biggest and richest car dealers?), have just made an advert that casts a spotlight on the health and environmental impact of the diesel fuel technology available to","['Diesel was the dream fuel, promoted by governments and the car industry as a cheaper way to save the planet. Then the cracks started to appear', 'A shopper at a supermarket asks for a plastic bag, only to have his head slammed into the checkout counter by the “green police” (“You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy”). Another man attracts a spotlight from a green police helicopter for a “compost infraction” as he’s about to bin an orange rind. The green police bust down doors after finding batteries in the trash. They haul people from their homes for installing incandescent lightbulbs.', 'But to the driver who approaches a road checkpoint in his Audi, the green police react very differently. “Clean diesel? You’re good to go, sir.” And they wave him through.', 'It’s hard to believe, as diesel vehicles find themselves thrust into the spotlight of a global urban environment crisis, that Audi’s Superbowl advert was made just seven years ago. Air pollution now kills 3.3 million people prematurely every year – more than HIV, malaria and influenza combined – with emissions from diesel engines among the worst culprits; a joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace showed hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across England and Wales are being exposed to illegal air toxicity levels from diesel vehicles. And yet such was the more or less widely accepted thinking as recently as Superbowl XLIV in 2010 – namely, that cars running on diesel fuel could be driven with a pure, unclouded conscience.', 'Diesel was touted at inception as a wonder fuel. It was a way of driving cost-efficiently while doing your bit to save the planet. Government, industry and science united to sell us the dream: cars running on diesel would help us cut our CO2 emissions as we eased smoothly into a new eco-friendly age.', 'It was particularly owing to advances in engine technology that the diesel passenger car market was able to blossom in the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Drivers liked the fuel efficiency of diesel engines, which made running costs cheaper than petrol over the long term. Governments, meanwhile, alarmed by rising carbon emissions, began advising citizens to switch to diesels, which were thought to emit less CO2 than their petrol counterparts. Diesel’s biggest moment in the UK was probably in 2001, when Gordon Brown, then chancellor of the Labour government, cut fuel duty on diesel vehicles as a deliberate effort to encourage people to switch.', 'It turns out we were wrong', 'The cracks took a long time to appear, but when they did they splintered rapidly. In 2012 came the first major evidence of some truly dreadful health impacts. Nitrogen oxides and dioxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) pumped out by diesel exhausts were fingered as silent killers. The studies multiplied. The European Environment Agency found that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from diesel fumes had caused around 71,000 premature deaths across the continent in a single year. It said the UK experienced 11,940 annual premature deaths from NO2, the second highest in Europe behind Italy. The World Health Organisation declared diesel exhaust a carcinogenic, a cause of lung cancer in the same category as asbestos and mustard gas.', 'Then in 2015 came Dieselgate. In September of that year, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota for top spot in the list of world’s biggest car companies and a firm that had for years been running its own marketing campaign in favour of “clean diesel”, rocked the industry by admitting that it had cheated on its emission tests. As recently as last week, David King, the UK government’s former chief scientific adviser on climate change, admitted ministers had made a huge mistake by promoting diesel. They had trusted the car industry when it said the fuel was clean. “It turns out we were wrong,” he said.', 'Cities worldwide have scrambled. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have agreed to completely outlaw diesel vehicles from the centre of their cities by 2025. The political leaders that make up the C40 group of global megacities are all taking steps to crack down on diesel vehicles and reduce smog. But other cities, including British ones, are tinkering around the edges; London is proposing low-emission zones and toll charges, but has stopped short of a ban.', 'So is this simply a period of bad PR, or has the backlash against diesel reached a tipping point? Has the one-time wonder fuel become the new asbestos – not to say mustard gas? And if this is really the beginning of the end for diesel, how much longer before the pariah is banished from the city for good?', 'Banning diesel is trickier than it seems. The scale of the problem remains enormous. Diesel never made huge inroads into the US, where gasoline remained cheap, and where American automakers focused their innovation efforts on hybrid and electric vehicles. But in Europe, diesel passenger cars remain a major part of the auto industry: astonishingly, they still account for nearly 50% of all new cars sold across the continent.', 'Meanwhile, a study of the latest diesel cars by the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) says real-world emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are, on average, seven times higher than safety limits allow. A separate ICCT study showed that latest diesel cars produce 10 times the NOx of heavy trucks or buses, which are more strictly regulated than cars.', 'The car manufacturers, too, have a hugely powerful lobby still at their disposal. According to Greg Archer, who once managed the UK government’s air pollution research, automakers used their influence to ensure a “regulatory holiday” after the financial crash. They claimed that the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standards, aimed at limiting pollutants from exhausts, led to significant reduction in pollutants. But a recent study of real-world performance shows those claims were bogus: Emissions Analytics found that 97% of the diesel cars made since 2011 exceed NOx safety limits.', 'Governments were complicit, too. In one particularly egregious case, Germany agreed in 2013 to halt a proposed EU cap on bankers’ bonuses – dreaded by the City of London – in return for British support to protect the German car industry and thwart a stricter emissions regime.', 'Nor is it easy to persuade drivers to switch. Many motorists are understandably angry that they were encouraged to invest in diesel engines but are now expected to face clean air zones, pollution charges and other restrictions. Many feel that they are, in effect, being punished for what they were told was the smart, responsible choice. Mazyar Keshvari, an MP from Norway’s right-wing Progress Party, calls Europe’s anti-diesel pivot “the biggest swindle”, since many drivers there were teased into buying diesels with tax incentives.', 'The UK government is keenly aware of the hypocrisy. The government must publish updated clean air plans by 24 April, but the prime minister, Theresa May, has indicated she does not want to punish existing diesel drivers. She says she is “very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars, and we need to take that into account”.', 'While national governments wring their hands, it is cities that are taking the lead. In Germany, Berlin has already banned the oldest, highest-polluting diesel cars from its centre, while Munich is developing a clean air ban that will bring in some form of diesel ban in 2018. The Spanish capital, Madrid, has now introduced a system to halve the number of cars on the roads during smog outbreaks, based on odd or even number plates on alternate days; various other cities have experimented with similar trials.', 'In January, Oslo city council introduced a ban on diesel cars for the first time, halting their use completely for one day (during a high pollution alert). The city also plans to raise the road toll for diesel cars entering the city centre from 33 Krone (£3) to 58 Krone (£5.50) in rush hour.', 'The cities that have moved boldest have been the ones least likely to get too concerned about the fact that motorists, having been told one thing, are now being told another. Some have worried this could lead to a damaging kind of cynicism – a more skeptical attitude toward the latest environmental research. But councillor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg of Oslo’s Green party doesn’t think that will happen.', '“It’s a long time ago now,” she says of the old pro-diesel incentives. “Since 2012 we’ve been talking about how bad (diesel) is for people’s health, and people are adjusting to the science. In the past year we’ve seen quite a big change in attitudes. People are well aware of the health implications now. They don’t think children and elderly people should have to stay in their homes to avoid pollution.”', 'Paris has been typically one of the more aggressive cities. Under mayor Anne Hidalgo, it introduced a system of coloured stickers to classify cars types and emission levels. Any diesel-run car made before 2000 will not be allowed on the roads inside the French capital. Diesel cars built between 2000 and 2010 could soon be subject to tighter restrictions, as the mayor tries to phase out diesel entirely by 2025.', 'Some French drivers are unhappy. A national campaign group, 40 Million Motorists, says the new system is unfair to poorer diesel drivers who cannot afford to buy a new cleaner car.', 'Romain Lacombe, founder of Plume Labs, a Paris-based organisation that monitors air quality around the world, is not persuaded by their argument. He backs the new system because “it means the oldest cars will be the first off the road, which makes a lot of sense”.', '“The stock of [diesel] vehicles will take time to be phased out, but I only see momentum building to move away from diesel,” says Lacombe. “There is a rising understanding of how damaging to health diesel emissions are to health. People are beginning to realise they are the first victim of their own vehicle. It’s a personal health issue, a life or death issue.”', 'When it is essential, you just have to do it', 'Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has stopped short of an outright ban on diesel, but he has ordered the replacement of the capital’s current diesel bus fleet with clean alternatives. The mayor’s office will also enforce a £10 toxicity charge, or T-charge, on the highest-polluting cars entering the city centre as of October. The measures are part of a wider plan to create an ultra-low-emission zone (ULEZ) in central London from April 2019.', 'Khan has expressly urged drivers to “ditch dirty diesel”, and has backed it up by urging the UK government to come up with a “national diesel scrappage fund” to fairly compensate diesel drivers, suggesting a sum of up to £3,500 offered for each car or van taken off the road.', 'The black cabs are, in some ways, a litmus test of whether diesel is on its way out. Many of the cabs use diesel, and drivers had initially complained about clean-air restrictions. But the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association (LTDA) now backs Khan’s idea of a scrappage fund. And last month the government and City Hall both announced a plug-in taxi grant scheme giving cabbies £7,500 to buy new electric models built in Coventry. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA, predicts diesel cabs will be “a thing of the past” within six years.', 'Although nearly three-quarters of all the world’s diesel cars are driven on European roads, bold moves are being made elsewhere, too. Hong Kong has introduced subsidies to help phase out older diesel vehicles. Later this year Seoul will ban all diesels made before 2006 from a city-centre low emission zone.', 'But it is in in Mexico City, where mountains surrounding the metropolis help trap a semi-permanent blanket of smog over the city, that mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera has decided to ban diesel completely by 2025.', '“I know it is a good thing for the city,” Mancera said on a recent visit to London to meet Sadiq Khan’s team. “It’s something that is absolutely essential to protect the environment. We’re changing: our taxis have to be electric or hybrid, and our buses are being changed from diesel to new technologies.”', 'The mayor has also pledged to invest more in the public transport system and cycling lanes, and persuaded delivery companies to use their diesel trucks at night to reduce daytime emissions.', 'Will this work in a city where drivers are famously unruly? Mancera points to the 1992 scheme called Hoy No Circula (No Driving Today), which forbade the worst-polluting vehicles from being on the roads one day a week; the rules have since been tightened to include a Saturday daytime ban for the worst polluters. “It’s totally unpopular,” Mancera says. “It’s the most unpopular measure you can make – to stop people moving. Some people support it, but another part of the population get really irritated by it.”', 'But nevertheless, he says drivers will get used to the diesel ban the way they did to Hoy No Circula. “When it is essential, you just have to do it.”', 'Worldwide, polls suggest citizens of some big cities are beginning to put clean air before convenience. A YouGov poll last year showed 52% of Londoners would support a ban on diesel cars in London’s city centre; a similar poll in France on a ban on diesel in the centre by 2020 was backed by 54% of Parisians.', 'This is probably how the death of diesel will come about – not through regulation, but through consumer disgust. Many auto experts expect the global sales dip that followed Dieselgate to continue, as consumers turn up their nose and manufacturers correspondingly invest less in new models. “The regulations will deter people, at least people in big cities, from buying diesel cars at their next purchase if they think they are going to be restricted,” says professor David Bailey of Aston University.', 'Are car buyers entitled to have any confidence at all in buying diesel, or do we need to get rid of it altogether? Unfortunately it is difficult to determine precisely how the latest breed of diesel cars compare with petrol ones, pollution-wise. Since the Volkswagen scandal, no one has a great deal of faith in emission testing done in the laboratory.', 'A tougher on-the-road testing regime, the “real driving emissions” (RDE) tests, is set to begin across the EU in September. “There is a going to be a tightening up on testing and it will make diesels cars more expensive to make,” says Bailey. “It will mean a lot of diesels cars disappearing, because it won’t be worth it for the manufacturers.', '“I think a substantial reorientation will take place away from diesel, part of a larger shift away from the combustion engine toward electric cars in the 2020s.”', 'According to Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, a UK motoring research group, “the mere talk of action might already be altering buying behaviour”. He points to a recent dip in diesel car sales in the UK. But Gooding also argues that schemes to remove the highest-polluting diesel cars from the roads are impractical, mainly because working out exactly how “dirty” a car is remains difficult. “The issue is not just the age of a car, but where it’s driven, how far it’s driven and under what conditions,” he says. “Unfortunately, the data needed to target the most polluting vehicles accurately is not easily available.”', 'If smog-choked cities want the shift away from diesels to happen as quickly as possible, they will need the help of regulators – and also overcome the indifference of national governments. Oslo still has to convince the Norwegian transport ministry to approve its road toll hikes. Mancera will have to persuade the national government to replace the fleet of federally controlled diesel buses that chunter into Mexico City each day.', 'Yet the prize for hastening the decline of diesel could be huge – not least because, with so many big climate battles ahead of us, it would demonstrate that we and our political leaders can fix crises when science identifies them.', '“I’m optimistic we can see the end of diesel vehicles,” says Berg. “The end of diesel would be a pretty big change in a relatively short period of time.”', 'Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here']",0.4666666666599999

But because teams are so desperate they will reach, and that need to grasp at a QB will be the main story emerging from this draft.', ""It's why this scout, and so many in football that I interview, still believes the Patriots will trade backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo\xa0despite a report\xa0from Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo of NFL Network that the Texans and Browns likely won't be able to convince the Pats to part with him.

I also hear that the front office and (coach) Hue Jackson are clashing a bit over the direction they want to go. Hue wants a quarterback from the draft and they don't."", '2. 49ers: They want to trade down pretty bad. I think of all the teams in the top 10, they want to trade down the most. The problem for them is everyone knows this. So they probably stay put and take (Stanford DE) Solomon Thomas.', ""3. Bears: I'd be stunned if they didn't go defense. I hear teams are trying to trade into the Bears' spot, but the Bears, so far, are saying no. It's early, though. That third spot is pretty coveted by some teams because there's a belief among some that this draft has just three or four true stars. Most drafts I've been around, going in, there are a dozen or so guys you think can be big stars."", ""4. Jaguars: (Tom) Coughlin is running a dictatorship (in Jacksonville). You're not surprised.

I have to say; I haven't seen a capable quarterback like Cam Newton so ill-served by his front office. They need explosiveness. I wouldn't go running back here if I were them. I'd go best wide receiver. Get Cam lots of weapons."", '9. Bengals: A lot of what happens here is how much say Marvin Lewis still has.

Eagles: Obvious pick here is to grab the best DB they can. Their secondary is awful and that fact puts more pressure on their quarterback (Carson Wentz).', '15. Colts: This is where (Stanford RB Christian) McCaffrey goes. Perfect fit there. I (also) have one sleeper there: (Oklahoma RB) Joe Mixon.

But I think that owner (Jim Irsay) is crazy enough to do it.\xa0', ""16. Ravens: They might drop back into the 20s. They want a pass-rusher, but I'm hearing they think they can get one later in the first and pick up some picks."", ""17. Washington: Watching that scouting department closely. I've told you this before; there are some people there still in shock over how Scot (McCloughan) was treated (the former general manager who was fired). They are professionals and will do their job, but there are people there constantly looking over their shoulders. That has to cause some issues."", ""18. Titans: They go DB here. But I wouldn't be shocked if they traded down from their early pick (fifth)\xa0and\xa0here. They're not crazy about this draft."", ""19. Buccaneers: It's a smart crew there (in the front office), and they know the priority is to get protection for Jameis Winston. There's also a chance they surprise people and get a wide receiver."", ""20. Broncos: One of the few teams I don't have a good feel for. I feel like John Elway is a bit of a wild card in this draft."", ""21. Lions: They want (Wisconsin LB) T.J. Watt. This is too high a spot to take him. He should be late second or early third round, but that Watt name is so powerful there's a rush for T.J., and I have to say he's very good. Just to me not first-round good."", '22. Dolphins: The fight to finish second in the division to the Patriots goes well for the Dolphins. (Me: That was pretty funny.) I think they add an offensive lineman. Really, they need to just keep stacking that defense to try to stop (Tom) Brady.', '23. Giants: I think the way the Giants are looking at things is they may only have Eli (Manning, who is 36 years old) a few more years, so I see them continuing to load up that offense.', ""24. Raiders: One of the most impressive turnarounds I've ever seen from a team. That coaching staff and front office developed into a good group. My only concern is: Will the front office feel pressure from ownership to make splashy moves (in the draft) as a way to get people in Las Vegas excited? Not football moves, but splashy moves."", ""25. Texans:\xa0They need a quarterback. Watch for Tony Romo here, too. There's better than a 60 or 70 percent chance Romo ends up playing for them at some point this coming season. That story is far from dead."", '26. Seahawks: They need massive offensive line help. This seems like one of the easiest predictions in the draft that they take an offensive lineman.', ""27. Chiefs: If they already didn't have one player publicly known for hitting a woman (wide receiver Tyreek Hill), they would take a chance on Mixon.\xa0"", ""28. Cowboys: They have very few weaknesses from top to bottom. The one thing they're missing is a top young pass-rusher. If they're able to find one of those guys in the draft, they'll be almost impossible to stop."", ""29. Packers: If they don't go defense here, everyone in that scouting department should be fired."", ""30. Steelers: This is one of the more interesting spots in the draft. The Steelers need defensive help, but they also need a quarterback of the future. Big Ben might have one or two years left. I expect the Steelers to wait one more year to get a quarterback, but what if one of this year's good ones somehow falls here?"", ""31. Falcons: Tom Brady all but guaranteed they'd go defensive back here. They need to build up that secondary even more."", ""32. Saints:\xa0(Me: Originally I asked the scout about the Pats here.

""It didn\'t represent the area, or who they are as people.""', 'Richardson, who designed current logos for the Hornets, Grizzlies, Kings, Hawks, and Pelicans, also heard a weird mix of nostalgia and frustration in talking for almost a year with local residents. They had fond memories of the team\'s first logo, nicknamed ""Old Shep.""', 'That didn\'t surprise team employees. ""It represents the franchise getting here,"" Ted Johnson, the team\'s chief strategy officer, told ESPN.com. ""People love it, even though we didn\'t win. They remember Kevin Harlan as the voice of the team, and the general excitement.""', 'The Target Center is dotted with 1990s-era throwbacks every game night.', 'But focus groups told Richardson that Shep was too nice -- almost too clichéd a representation of the ""Minnesota nice"" ethos. Fans didn\'t want the team to stand for nice anymore. The Wolves haven\'t made the playoffs since 2004. Fans stopped coming, and even the buzz of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and Tom Thibodeau hasn\'t brought them back; the Wolves rank 29th in attendance as measured by capacity filled, ahead of only the relocating Pistons.', '""There is an immense amount of frustration here,"" Johnson said', '""People were ready for something more aggressive,"" Richardson said.', 'The new logo is part of a franchise overhaul designed to satisfy that urge for something new -- and show the commitment is real. Before next season starts, the Wolves will debut new uniforms, a new court design, and a renovated arena.', ""Richardson and his team took in all the feedback, scanned Minnesota's old logos and uniforms, and formed a general idea of what people seemed to want. The actual drawing comes last. Richardson doesn't sketch anything until he can write out something of a mission statement, confined to a few sentences on a scrap of paper, encapsulating the qualities the logo should represent. His card for the Wolves read:"", 'With fierce determination we will defend, and we will devour. We will be smarter. We will be stronger. We will be together. We will be ... a Pack.', 'They eventually ended up here:', 'They toyed with more adventurous designs: multiple wolves, multiple wolf heads, stylized triangular wolf heads that reminded Johnson of aliens, crazy colors, a wolf that stared directly at you, snarling wolves, and hunting wolves walking on all fours. They all seemed too garish, and too close to the over-animated schtick fans wanted gone.', 'Richardson aimed instead for something he hopes is both ominous and understated. The head-alone design is an intentional nod to both Shep, and the (awesome) alternate logo the Wolves have used on the side since 2008:', '""We didn\'t just want to wipe everything off the table and ignore it,"" Richardson said.', 'The slate blue inside the basketball is a carryover from past logos, which also featured different shades of green. The navy blue in the background is new for the team. They opted for a howling wolf instead of a snarling one after learning about what each action signaled.', '""The howl is a warning,"" Richardson said. ""It marks their territory. It\'s a communal call to the rest of the pack -- a rallying cry."" That meshed with the idea of a team coming together to defend home court. Richardson learned in his research that wolves sometimes snarl and bare their teeth when they are scared, or defensive -- emotions that don\'t fit as well in the macho sports world.', ""The darker blue evokes nighttime. The intent is for viewers to sort of viscerally feel what it might be like to walk outside at night and hear that howl. Target Center seats will be colored in that shade once the renovation is complete before next season, Ethan Casson, the team's CEO, told ESPN.com."", ""They also chose to have the wolf howling at the North Star instead of the moon, an obvious local reference that works nicely. They stuck the star in the center of the ball's lacing, and colored it the same shade of green as the wolf's eye and the tip of its nose. (Look for the ball with the star in it to reappear, sans wolf, as a secondary logo.)"", 'They nicknamed the color ""Aurora Green,"" Richardson said. It is supposed to mimic the greenish hue that can sometimes emanate from the Northern Lights. Richardson also noticed that in the winter, the sun reflecting off glass buildings in downtown Minneapolis can give off a green light.', '""There\'s something icy and wintry about it,"" Richardson said.', 'They went basic and clean on the font after experimenting with Nordic runes. The strange ""A,"" missing the horizontal connector, is a remnant of the runes phase that made it into the final design.', 'You can say goodbye to the most recent logo. The Wolves will not shift it into some secondary status just to keep it alive. ""It will be retired,"" Casson said.', 'More good news: The Wolves are scrapping their hideous, butterscotchy court design for next season, and revamping their uniforms. Some of the riskier motifs they left on the logo cutting room floor will pop up in those places. ""As we get into those other elements,"" Johnson said, ""we are going to be more aggressive.""', ""The team knows none of this will matter if they don't win. The new logo is meant to be part of a larger franchise transformation that includes making the playoffs and chasing even bigger things. The team might not even be pushing all these changes together if they didn't think those on-court goals were feasible over the next half decade, officials said."", '""Fans haven\'t seen a way for us to the corner,"" Johnson said. ""They are quick to leave. But they are quick to come back. They see the team we have, and feel like winning is in our grasp for the first time in a long time.""']",0.59999999996

NASA to announce new discoveries about ocean worlds," Cassini has surveyed and may have caught sight of an entirely novel type's ocean on Saturn's moon Titan, and researchers believe there might be similar water worlds on other planets.","[""(CNN)NASA will present new discoveries about the ocean worlds in our solar system on Thursday, the agency announced. Learning more about ocean worlds could help in the agency's quest for life beyond Earth."", 'The findings were gathered by researchers through the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft. Cassini has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, and the mission ends this year.', '""During its time at Saturn, Cassini has made numerous dramatic discoveries, including a global ocean that showed indications of hydrothermal activity within the icy moon Enceladus, and liquid methane seas on its moon Titan,"" NASA said in a release.', ""Earth is considered an ocean world because those bodies of water cover the majority of the planet's surface. Other ocean worlds in our solar system potentially include Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto; Saturn's moons Enceladus, Mimas and Titan; Neptune's moon Triton; and the dwarf planet Pluto."", 'It is believed that Venus and Mars were once ocean worlds, but the greenhouse gas effect and a vulnerable atmosphere, respectively, caused those planets to lose them.', 'The Europa mission', ""NASA plans to further explore ocean worlds in our solar system, including through the recently named Europa Clipper mission. This mission will investigate Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a salty liquid water ocean containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans beneath an icy crust."", 'Researchers want to know whether Europa could support life in its ocean. They spotted water plumes rising 125 miles above the surface in September using the Hubble Telescope.', ""Europa could be the best case for life in our solar system outside of Earth, said Britney Schmidt, assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences."", 'Schmidt is also one of the architects of the project that became the Europa Clipper mission. She and two other researchers came up with the name while sitting in a hotel room during a conference.', 'The Europa Clipper, named for the innovative, streamlined ships of the 1800s, will launch in the 2020s and arrive at Europa after a few years.', '""The reason we chose it is because the clipper ships were fast, American boats at the time that they were first used, when most shipping was achieved with large, slow vessels,"" Schmidt said. ""We liked clipper for that reason, an ingenious way to solve the Europa mission problem: How do you get a long-lived mission at Europa with global coverage but not be in the radiation environment?""', 'Because that region of the solar system traps atomic particles from the sun, the radiation of the area around Jupiter is dangerous to spacecraft.', ""Schmidt will be an investigator for the ice-penetrating radar instrument that will be housed on the Europa Clipper. It will act like an X-ray, peering through the unknown thickness of Europa's icy crust the same way scientists use earthquakes to assess the interior of the Earth."", 'Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission saw long lines and dark spots, as opposed to a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo mission reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet.', ""But because neighboring Mars has fueled imaginations and the possibility of exploring another planet for years, the general public hasn't been as captivated by Jupiter's moon. There are arguments that life could exist on Mars, but it was most likely habitable in the past, when it supported bodies of water and had a more hospitable climate and an atmosphere."", '""The question is, do you want to study something that might have been habitable at one time, or do you want to study something that could be habitable right now?"" Schmidt asked. ""Europa has been pretty much Europa for 4.5 billion years, as long as the Earth has. So as far as what could have started and evolved there, that\'s a compelling question.', '""If you think about early Earth and early Europa, they were probably very similar, at least at the ocean interface. They are almost the same place at that point in time. That\'s why I get excited about Europa. It could have been a place for life over the history of the solar system.""']",0.0

Yet America’s airlines are exceptionally awful', 'It has become apparent that America’s airlines, much like America’s president, have absolutely no shame. They seem to care only about profit and treat the people they supposedly serve like chattel, cattle or criminals.', 'This week’s installment of airlines reaching new lows is brought to you by United – you know, the people who spend tens of millions of dollars on fancy adverts urging you to “Fly the Friendly Skies”, while seemingly going out of their way to make the skies as unfriendly as possible.', 'The story has been everywhere over the last 24 hours and you’ve probably seen the graphic video. United overbooked a flight and, having only realized this after the flight had boarded, tried to force a few randomly selected passengers off. One man refused to vacate the seat he paid for and, thus, had a reasonable expectation of sitting in. Security officers dragged the 69-year-old grandfather off the plane screaming. This was all caught on video and went viral.', 'You’d think that United might have balked at this PR disaster and issued a groveling apology. Particularly as the incident comes hot on the heels of last month’s controversy around United denying boarding to two teenage girls because they were wearing leggings. But no.', 'The furore was followed by perhaps the most half-assed sorry-not-sorry in the history of corporate apologies, with United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz expressing regret for “having to re-accommodate these customers”. Yes, that’s right, they translated “dragged a man out of a plane screaming” into “re-accommodate”.', 'Somewhere, in the depths of United HQ, there is a team of copywriters tasked with systematically wringing any actual meaning out of the English language and transforming it into hollow, hyphenated platitudes.', 'But, really, is anyone actually surprised at United’s lack of compunction?

Carriers can basically do whatever they like and get away with it. After all, what are you going to do? Take a bus?', 'Short of boycotting flying altogether there’s basically no way for customers to hold airlines to account. So we just hand them our money and grin and bear it. We expect airlines to be awful. And low expectations are lucrative; while airlines like to cry poor to justify incessant cost-cutting, last year global airlines made profits of $35bn.', 'The industry-wide of practice of overbooking, which the United episode brought to light, is just one example of the airline industry’s hubris at work. In theory, overbooking should be good for everyone. It ensures that more seats are full and should help drive ticket prices down. However, there aren’t enough regulations in place to protect customers from overbooking, which means airlines can deny boarding to passengers without offering adequate compensation.', 'United offered passengers $800 to get off the plane before it brought in the security guards. Federal law in America means it could have gone up to $1,350 but no further. Surely there should be a minimum cap on compensation due to overbooking, not a maximum cap?', 'While airlines across the world appear to be engaged in a race to the bottom when it comes to customer experience, it is America’s airlines which stand out as exceptionally awful. The enormous amount of consolidation in the American airline industry means that there is very little competition. Brands that try to compete on customer experience rarely last long. Indeed, Alaska Airlines recently announced it was killing off the Virgin America brand earlier this year.', 'Over the last few years the Gulf Carriers – Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates – have been making inroads into the American market. These airlines put more of an emphasis on customer service and the threat of competition has caused much uproar amongst the big American carriers.', 'Rather than attempting to better their own service and compete in that regard, however, American airlines have been looking to their government to try and stifle competition – claiming that they can’t possibly compete with Gulf carriers because they have more money.', 'In February the CEOs of American Airlines, United and Delta asked to meet with secretary of state Rex Tillerson to discuss “the massive subsidization of three state-owned Gulf carriers – Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates – and the significant harm this subsidized competition is causing to US airlines and US jobs.”', 'Weirdly, shortly after this demand for a meeting, the US Department of Homeland Security announced a ban on electronics larger than a mobile phone which targeted 10 Middle Eastern airports and nine airlines – including the major Gulf carriers which American carriers are so outraged by.', 'There have been accusations that this is simply a roundabout way of stifling competition rather than furthering national security. And, indeed, the electronics ban does appear to achieve very little in terms of national security. If you’re committed enough to turn your Kindle into a bomb you’ll probably also be able to figure out that you can still take said Kindle on a flight to the US with another airline.', 'The latest United debacle is unlikely to be the last time airlines hit the news for appalling behavior.

How the sun helped spark life on Earth," The early world on which life was modeled could have used the solar energy provided by our dearest star to create more complex materials, possibly aiding a future crop of biofuels.","['High energy, ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a known to hazard to life, yet the energy provided by our star has played an important role as the essential driver of life on Earth.\xa0', 'Before life began, radiation from the sun was the primary source of energy on our planet, just as it is today. In this oxygen-poor, prebiotic world, solar energy may have provided the jolt to transform simple organic molecules into more complex ones, which were used as the\xa0building blocks of biology and life.\xa0', 'A new paper by two University of Colorado at Boulder authors considers how this might have happened through a review of existing literature on the topic. [Brewing Life On Earth - Violent Sun, Weak Shielding May Have Contributed (Video)]', 'Stunning views of the distant solar system 40 light-years away that NASA announced Wednesday', '“We’re looking at examples in the literature and from our own lab where sunlight has been used to build complex molecules from simple, prebiotically-available starting materials,” said lead author Rebecca Rapf, a doctoral candidate in physical chemistry.\xa0', 'The paper, “Sunlight as an energetic driver in the synthesis of molecules necessary for life,” co-authored by her advisor, Veronica Vaida, recently appeared in the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. Rapf’s work is supported by a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship as well as funds from NASA’s Habitable Worlds Program.', 'The lack of oxygen\xa0in the early atmosphere\xa0means that more high-energy ultraviolet radiation from the sun would have reached the surface of the prebiotic Earth than today, where it is filtered by ozone. Even though this component of sunlight can be destructive to certain biomolecules, the energy provided could still be useful to early life chemistry, Rapf said. “Even if you destroy a molecule, it is broken into smaller, very reactive chunks that readily undergo additional reactions, recombining to form larger high-energy molecules.”', 'In particular, the researchers were intrigued by a group of oxygen-laden acids called oxoacids. An example is pyruvic acid, which is at the center of key metabolic pathways in life today. When dissolved in water and illuminated with ultraviolet light, pyruvic acid is known to react to make larger molecules, with higher yields under the oxygen-limited conditions that would be found on the early Earth.\xa0', 'Pyruvic acid is only one of a class of molecules that react in the same way to form these larger species. Another molecule in this class, 2-oxooctanoic acid, is particularly interesting because it is an example of a simple lipid. 2-oxooctanoic acid was likely “prebiotically relevant,” Rapf added, meaning it could be useful to the chemistry that eventually led to life.', 'In an\xa0earlier study\xa0on 2-oxooctanoic acid, Rapf and Vaida found that exposing it to light forms a more complex molecule, dihexyltartaric acid. This is noteworthy because the new molecule has two alkyl chains, meaning it more closely resembles the lipids that are in modern cells, which also have two tails. This light-driven process, discovered in the Vaida lab, is one of only a few ways to make double-tailed lipids from simple, single-tailed molecules under prebiotic conditions.', '“We’re using sunlight as a way of building bigger molecules, but in order to be useful to the development of biology any molecules you build have to be stable enough to exist in the environment,” added Rapf.\xa0', 'In the case of 2-oxooctanoic acid, the product, dihexyltartaric acid, does not absorb the same UV light and therefore, is protected from undergoing further photochemistry (chemical reactions as a result of sunlight). These double-tailed lipids also spontaneously assemble into membrane-enclosed compartments, resembling simple protocells that are necessary to the evolution of life.

Seniors could be in for a rude surprise if Paul Ryan gets his way on taxes," The Wall Post's Matt); The Associated's Tom spread this story on the front porch of her house in rural Maryland, looking out across the garden:.","['\xa0', 'Republicans have a plan to cut trillions of dollars in taxes while still having enough money to run the\xa0government thanks in large part to what\xa0opponents call a new tax on imports.', 'But the proposal could have costly unintended consequences — especially for the elderly.', 'Retirees are financially vulnerable to rising prices, or inflation, which is one possible result of the GOP plan. If the proposal sets off inflation, many households would benefit from increasing wages and salaries. Meanwhile, some retirees would pay\xa0more at the cash register without the benefit of a fatter paycheck.', 'Economists dispute exactly what would happen if Republicans put the plan, called a border adjustment, into effect. Many experts say the proposal would not prove inflationary, and others debate by how much prices are likely to increase. Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the speaker of the House and architect of this “border adjustment” plan, and his colleagues included the idea in a white paper on tax reform last year.', 'But according to a new report published this week by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, other countries that have implemented border adjustments have often seen inflation follow.', ""“That could fall heavily on the elderly,” said economist Caroline Freund, who wrote the report along with colleague Joseph Gagnon. “It's a really underappreciated point.”"", 'The pair did not give an estimate of how much inflation a border adjustment would produce, but a substantial increase is possible, given the ambitious scope of the Republican plan.', 'Among the elderly, households that rely exclusively\xa0for retirement on benefits that are\xa0indexed to inflation — such as Social Security — would enjoy some protection. Wealthy households would be able to insulate\xa0their savings by investing in stocks and other equities. Prices on Wall Street would also climb if inflation picked up.', 'Those most negatively affected would be households with savings invested in bonds, certificates of deposit and other fixed-income securities. Likewise, those with pensions that are not adjusted for inflation, such as many private-sector defined-benefit pensions, would lose some of the value of their benefits.', '“It’s a good time for people to be evaluating their investments,” Freund said. “Inflation has been so low for so long, people may have forgotten that sometimes you need to protect against it.”', 'Inflation in the United States has been declining for decades, and by one measure, annual inflation has not exceeded 3 percent since 2008. The Republican proposal could reverse that trend.', 'With a border adjustment, corporations would no longer be able to deduct the costs of imported goods and services from their incomes.\xa0At the same time, corporations would not have to pay taxes on income from exports abroad.', 'Demand for products made in the United States could rise both domestically and around the world.', 'Domestically, goods and services produced in the United States would become relatively cheaper compared to products from foreign competitors because of the tax on imports. The same would be true of U.S. exports on sale in foreign countries. U.S. producers would seek to hire more workers to meet that demand.', 'One result could be rapid inflation across the economy.', ""For example, in the year after New Zealand imposed a 10 percent tax with a border adjustment in 1986, inflation accelerated by seven percentage points, according to Freund and Gagnon's report. A three percentage point jump followed when Australia implemented a similar tax in 2000."", 'Inflation would eventually cancel out the advantages of domestic products. Although goods produced in the United States would not be subject to tax, the cost of producing them would have increased because of demand.', 'In the long term, the overall amount that the country imports and exports would be largely unaffected, and although workers would enjoy higher wages, they would also pay more for everything.', 'In this sense, the new report does not buttress the arguments from opponents of a border adjustment, such as Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). He and others have described the plan as a tax on imports that would put a crimp in the economy.', 'In other countries, however, border adjustments have accelerated economic expansion in the short term, and in the long term, prices for imports have merely increased along with prices for domestic products and wages. Freund and Gagnon find that most of these adjustments occur within three years.', 'Inflation would not just be a wash, though: Americans and especially the elderly could lose some of the value of their savings.', ""Proponents say a border adjustment would not be inflationary. Instead, they argue, the price of\xa0the dollar would increase relative to other currencies if the plan were enacted. Since American companies' exports would be exempt, foreigners holding dollars could make purchases with them without paying indirect taxes, increasing the value of their U.S. currency."", ""Similarly, Americans holding other currencies would have to pay taxes on any purchases they made with that money, so those currencies'\xa0value would decrease — at least according to this reasoning."", 'If so, prices for\xa0imports and exporters would not change. Importers would have to pay taxes, but they would be able to get more for their money with their more valuable dollars. Exporters would be exempt, but their customers overseas would have to pay more to buy those exports because U.S. currency would be more expensive. Demand for U.S. products and labor would not increase, nor would prices.', '“I don’t think prices will go up very much, but even if they did, we’re talking about a short-run adjustment,” said Alan Auerbach, a vocal advocate of a border adjustment and an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. The only Americans negatively affected would be those with\xa0investments in foreign countries, because the prices of those investments\xa0in dollars would fall.', ""A rapid shift in the exchange rate would put the brakes on inflation, but just how quickly or how completely the dollar's price would climb in response to a border adjustment is difficult to predict. Although inflation was typical in the historical examples Freund and Gagnon studied, there are reasons to think things might go differently in the United States."", 'Other countries typically use what are known as “value-added taxes,” which also apply to wages and salaries paid by firms.\xa0By contrast, in the GOP plan, firms would not have to pay taxes on their payrolls.\xa0Economists say that\xa0because of that distinction, domestic prices might not\xa0rise under the Republican plan as they have in countries that adopted\xa0value-added taxes.', ""On the other hand, Freund argues, the dollar's price may be held in place by powerful forces other than global trade. Dollars serve as a global reserve currency, and demand for them is strong in financial markets around the world, where they give businesses in different countries a reliable, standard system for making all kinds of deals. As a result, exchange rates might adjust more slowly, resulting in U.S. inflation."", 'Finally, the scale of the Republican plan is massive compared to similar policies implemented elsewhere. New Zealand and Australia implemented border-adjusted taxes at rates of 10 percent, while the Republican plan calls for a 20 percent rate, and many observers think any reform that is ultimately enacted might impose an even higher tax.', 'Over the long run, economists say that a 20 percent rate adjusted at the border implies a 25 percent increase in the cost of U.S. goods, services and labor in terms of foreign currency. It is difficult to know how the economy would respond to such a shift. Yet even if most of the adjustment occurs through an appreciation of the dollar and only partially as a result of inflation, the effect on households budgets could be serious.', ""“That's just such a big number,” Freund said."", ""The question is crucial to Republicans' overall legislative agenda. They are planning on cutting taxes on businesses and households across the board, so they need\xa0some other source of money\xa0to keep the heat on in government buildings."", 'The border adjustment would\xa0give Republicans some of the money they need, but the risk of inflation could reinforce opposition to the already beleaguered plan. In February, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said the border adjustment was ""on life support” — although Republicans still have not put forward an alternative.', 'White House officials told The Washington Post on Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering other means of raising revenue — among them, a value-added tax.

"Tillerson, on Eve of Russia Trip, Takes Hard Line on Syria "," As Washington and New.......,,...,., sorry, maybe, I think - very soon!,","['WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is taking a hard line against Russia on the eve of his first diplomatic trip to Moscow, calling the country “incompetent” for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons and accusing Russia of trying to influence elections in Europe using the same methods it employed in the United States.', 'Mr. Tillerson’s comments, made in interviews aired on Sunday, were far more critical of the Russian government than any public statements by President Trump, who has been an increasingly lonely voice for better ties with Russia. They seemed to reflect Mr. Tillerson’s expectation, which he has expressed privately to aides and members of Congress, that the American relationship with Russia is already reverting to the norm: one of friction, distrust and mutual efforts to undermine each other’s reach.', '“This was inevitable,” said Philip H. Gordon, a former Middle East coordinator at the National Security Council who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Trump’s early let’s-be-friends initiative was incompatible with our interests, and you knew it would end with tears.” The Russians’ behavior has not changed, Mr. Gordon added, and they “are using every means they can — cyber, economic arrangements, intimidation — to reinsert themselves around the Middle East and Europe.”', 'Mr. Tillerson made it clear he agreed with that view, sweeping past Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence, despite the conclusion of American intelligence agencies, that there was no evidence of Russian interference in last year’s election. The meddling “undermines any hope of improving relations,” Mr. Tillerson said on ABC’s “This Week,” “not just with the United States, but it’s pretty evident that they’re taking similar tactics into electoral processes throughout Europe.”', 'Such tough talk will make Mr. Tillerson’s job even harder when he arrives Tuesday for the first visit to Moscow by a top Trump administration official. While he must offer sharp warnings to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and to President Vladimir V. Putin, if they meet — it was unclear whether such a meeting had been quietly arranged — he must also find a way forward with them to counter the Islamic State and then deal with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.', 'Yet as Mr. Tillerson arrived in Italy to meet with foreign ministers before going to Moscow, the administration was sending conflicting signals about its policy on Syria and the extent to which it would hold the country’s patron Russia responsible for continued violence.', 'Mr. Tillerson and the new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” said the American attack last week on a Syrian air base was intended solely to halt future chemical attacks, not to destabilize or overthrow the Assad government.', '“What’s significant about the strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime’s capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people,” said General McMaster, who is new to the Sunday television circuit, “but it was to be a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians.”', 'Neither man would commit to further military action in Syria even if Mr. Assad continued to kill civilians in large numbers by conventional means rather than with the chemical weapons that prompted Mr. Trump to reverse his stance on intervention. Instead, Mr. Tillerson said that defeating the Islamic State remained the first priority. Only then, he said, would he turn to a cease-fire process leading to elections, so that “the Syrian people can decide the fate of Assad.”', 'But the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, suggested that such a process was doomed as long as Mr. Assad was in power. “We know there’s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime,” she said on CNN. “If you look at his actions, if you look at the situation, it’s going to be hard to see a government that’s peaceful and stable with Assad.”', 'That statement stood in contrast not only to Mr. Tillerson’s comments but also to Ms. Haley’s own remarks a week ago — before Mr. Assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians — in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the United States.', 'Still, the overall tone of suspicion and condemnation of Russia’s actions in Syria indicated that Mr. Trump’s top national security advisers were nudging him back to a more traditional Russia policy. During his days as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson received a friendship award from Mr. Putin, and he is aware of the suspicions surrounding those ties and has gone the furthest in the administration in separating himself from the Russian leader.', 'The challenges have only multiplied in recent days. The Russians, angry about the attack on the air base, have threatened to cut off a communication line that the American and Russian militaries have used to notify each other about air operations in Syria. And the attack has forced Mr. Putin into a tighter relationship with Mr. Assad, perhaps tighter than the Russian leader wants.', 'Ms. Haley, who, like Mr. Tillerson, is new to diplomacy, has also apparently concluded that a hard line toward Russia is the safest course. The contrast between her remarks and Mr. Trump’s warm words for Mr. Putin on the campaign trail — as well as his refusal to acknowledge Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election — has been striking.', 'The Trump administration’s Syria policy has been difficult to parse. Mr. Tillerson, in his first television appearances since taking office, seemed to describe two different strategic objectives: halting chemical attacks and ultimately negotiating a cease-fire. But he made it clear that he had no intention of backing a military intervention that would overthrow Mr. Assad. That suggested that as long as the dictator used conventional means to kill his own people — barrel bombs instead of sarin gas — the United States would keep its distance.', '“I think what the United States and our allies want to do is to enable the Syrian people to make that determination” about Mr. Assad’s fate, Mr. Tillerson said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” — a line that was often used by his predecessor in the Obama administration, John Kerry. “You know, we’ve seen what violent regime change looks like in Libya and the kind of chaos that can be unleashed.”', 'Those remarks indicate that Mr. Trump does not yet have a grander strategy for Syria. Longtime Middle East experts said that might be a good thing.', '“I for one am glad he does not have a fully thought-through strategy on Syria, because if he did, he’d probably get it wrong,” said Ryan C. Crocker, perhaps the most experienced American career diplomat in the region, and dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.', '“There are too many variables, too many unknowns,” he said, among them the expectation of American allies, including Saudi Arabia, that Mr. Trump should emphasize getting rid of Mr. Assad over defeating the Islamic State.']",0.06666666666

It cost her around $25,000 to outfit her mobile money-earner with water tanks, a generator, hair-dryers, sinks, shelves and chairs — everything that goes with a salon.', '“It was difficult in the beginning,” she said. For one thing, she needed zoning from the city of Alexandria, where she lives. She worked with the city’s zoning manager, who helped adapt a zoning code covering her vehicular business.', '“If I knew what I know now, I would have done it a long time ago,” she said.', 'That’s because she keeps all the money from her jobs in the RV. She doesn’t have to share those haircut fees with a salon owner.', '“It’s a blessing,” she said of her motorized salon. Using it three days a week helped boost her income from $60,000 to $72,000.', 'Williams still runs a portion of her styling business the conventional way: renting space in a salon off Duke Street in Alexandria. She pays $300 to $400 a week for the spot, using it from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.', 'She revs up the RV for its rounds on Tuesdays and Thursdays, cutting hair from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. And on Sundays starting in May, she will motor to the West End Farmers Market at Cameron Station in Alexandria, where she will serve clients from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. She also tries to squeeze in one wedding party a month.', 'Williams said she goes anywhere in Virginia and Maryland. The truck does not yet travel to the District for insurance reasons.', 'The nice thing about the hair business is its recurring revenue: Hair never stops growing.', 'The more efficiently and cheaply you can tend to clients’ hair, the more you can earn. That’s where the truck comes in. Williams uses it to employ a hub-and-spoke strategy: She parks in one place and the customers — most of whom are in Alexandria, Woodbridge and Arlington — come to her.', 'She’ll park near Marymount University in Arlington or in a neighborhood like Buchholz’s, where nine or 10 customers can stream in over several hours, which saves on inefficient long-distance schlepping from house to house. Williams said she can get up to 13 walk-ins at the Sunday farmers market, earning hundreds of dollars depending on the customers’ needs.', 'Her prices run the gamut. A man getting his beard trimmed pays $17. It’s $30 to $40 for a men’s shampoo and haircut, and $45 to $60 for women. Prices run all the way up to $205 for a keratin treatment and $260 for “weave-ins.”', 'Williams likes cutting hair, but a lot of what she does is listening. Some professors would call that a “stick” business because it keeps the customers coming back.', '“We are like therapists . . . like healers to our clients,” she said. “They come and share and we give them positive input. For the most part, we have conversations about life in general.”', 'Customers like Buchholz love the flexibility.', '“I had several friends that were her clients,” said Buchholz, who started patronizing Williams before the mobile salon rode into the picture. “Unlike many beauticians, she worked on Mondays.”', 'Williams has been cutting hair since graduating from Lake Braddock High School in 1988. Her father ran his own car-repair business in Falls Church. Her mother has had her own housecleaning business. Both instilled the entre\xadpre\xadneur\xadship bug in her.', '“They figured out that instead of making other people rich, just put the money in your own pocket,” she said.', 'Williams started out at Hair Cuttery, where she earned a $4 commission (50 percent) on every $8 haircut. It was a slog, but she eventually pushed her income to $32,000 a year before moving to another salon in the same shopping center that charged more per haircut, which meant that her 50 percent commission went up.', 'Williams learned some important business lessons early on, such as convincing people that you care what they think of you.', 'That meant looking the part.', '“I was stylish and very professional,” she said. “When you look professional, you look like you know what you are doing. You are comfortable. And it gives people confidence in you.”', 'The RV came of necessity. One of her clients asked whether she would drive to her house once a month in rural Virginia and cut her hair.', 'Williams would pile into her Infiniti, drive out and charge about $110. Sometimes, the woman’s sister-in-law and children would show up too, asking for haircuts. That’s when Williams started thinking about the advantages of a mobile salon. The idea crystallized when she saw a news show on Fox 5 television about someone in Maryland with a mobile salon. She started trolling Craigslist for used RVs. She found a 1992 Rockwood RV with low mileage. She paid her handyman to build it out into a salon.', 'Her next plan is to expand to a second mobile salon built around nail care. Her dream is to one day have a fleet and go national. For now, she has fulfilled a need — both for her customers and herself.', '“It’s simply ingenious,” said Buchholz, who runs her own floral-delivery business out of her home.', '“When the mobile salon pulls up into my cul-de-sac, one by one she cuts and styles my daughters’ hair and mine,” she said. “I’m not cooling my heels in a salon, juggling my laptop or cellphone. I don’t lose any time in my day.”', 'When Williams’s mobile salon arrives in the morning, usually around 8:30 a.m., one of the neighbors sends out a text message to the local families, signaling that she’s in the neighborhood.', '“I so admire her for having the vision and the tenacity to make it happen. Local and state governments can be big obstacles to entrepreneurial ingenuity and Rubie did her homework and made it happen,” Buchholz said. “Most people would not have had the moxie to see their dream become reality.”']",0.33333333332

"Joining high court, the real Neil Gorsuch set to stand up ", The New Wire subcompact,"[""Somewhere between the Republican caricature of the next justice of the Supreme Court as a folksy family guy and the Democrats' demonization of him as a cold-hearted automaton, stands Neil Gorsuch."", 'Largely unknown six months ago, Gorsuch has seen his life story, personality and professional career explored in excruciating detail since he was nominated by President Donald Trump 10 weeks ago.', 'The portrait that emerges is more nuanced than the extremes drawn by his supporters and critics.', 'Gorsuch is widely regarded as a warm and collegial family man, boss and jurist, loyal to his employees and kind to those of differing viewpoints. He also has been shown to be a judge who takes such a ""rigidly neutral"" approach to the law that it can lead to dispassionate rulings with sometimes brutal results.', 'Four times during his confirmation hearings, Gorsuch invoked a ""breakfast table"" analogy, telling senators that good judges set aside what they have to eat — and their personal views — before they leave the house in the morning to apply the law and nothing else to the facts of the cases at hand. It was all part of Gorsuch\'s artful effort to reveal as little as possible of his own opinions.', '""We\'re all human beings,"" Gorsuch told senators, ""but the judge\'s job is to put that stuff aside and approach the law as you find it.""', ""That ability to compartmentalize, combined with Gorsuch's studious refusal to signal his thinking on contentious issues, left Democrats frustrated. For all his many visits with senators and his hours in the witness seat, Gorsuch had not revealed his core beliefs and may have, according to Democrats, a bias favoring powerful interests over ordinary people."", 'The question for Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., was ""whether there\'s a beating heart and an independent streak"" behind Gorsuch\'s silver hair and smooth delivery.', ""Republicans saw Gorsuch's disciplined and detached approach as evidence of the fair and independent mindset that the U.S. needs on its highest court."", ""Preparing to take the oath of office Monday after a rancorous 54-45 vote in the Senate, Gorsuch soon will largely recede into the cloistered halls of the Supreme Court. He won't vanish entirely; other justices have written books, done speaking tours and interviews."", ""But Gorsuch won't again face this kind of grilling, into everything from his views on abortion to the avid outdoorsman's favorite fishing holes. (He largely pleaded the Fifth on both.)"", ""The 49-year-old judge was happy to reminisce about his years as a student and lawyer before becoming a federal appellate judge in Denver 10 years ago. He relied on self-deprecating humor and a goodness-gosh-golly demeanor in outsize doses as he deflected the questions he didn't want to answer."", '""I might be a little corny,"" he said at one point to the Senate Judiciary Committee.', '""Oh, now we\'re talking,"" Gorsuch enthused when the talk turned to fly fishing. ""You can\'t focus on the worries of the world when you\'re only worried about a trout.""', ""Gorsuch's impressive scholarly and legal credentials were on full display: Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, the latter with scenes that Gorsuch recalled were straight out of a Harry Potter movie."", 'But Gorsuch, known for the clarity of his legal writings, traced the roots of his success back to an even earlier source, Sister Mary Rose Margaret, the nun of whom he says: ""She taught me how to read and she taught me how to diagram a sentence.""', 'Gorsuch, whose mother was a state legislator and then director of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan, tried to play down the political elements in his background. Gorsuch stressed that when issues such as torture arose during his time in President George W. Bush\'s Justice Department, he acted not as a policymaker but as a ""speechwriter"" or ""a lawyer for a client.""', 'He did acknowledge, though, that an email he sent criticizing lawyers at big firms for representing detainees being held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba was ""not my finest hour.""', 'Perhaps no ruling got more attention over the past 10 weeks than a case in which Gorsuch came down against a truck driver who was fired for leaving his trailer of meat on the side of an Illinois road after breaking down on a frigid night in 2009 and fearing he would freeze to death. Asked whether the man\'s firing wasn\'t absurd, Gorsuch said simply: ""My heart goes out to him. It\'s just not my job.""', 'For all that he shared, Gorsuch did his best not to telegraph where he might land on a range of topics that he could confront early in his time as a justice, even though both sides think they have a pretty good idea how he would rule.', ""Cases about voting rights, gun control, religious rights, housing discrimination and immigration are pending before the court. The dispute over Trump's proposed ban on visitors from six majority Muslim countries could be on the way as well."", 'Gorsuch was careful not to offer any hints on these issues in his exchanges with committee Democrats and Republicans.', 'Questioned about his views on the Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman\'s right to have an abortion, Gorsuch would go no further than to voice his respect for legal precedent and say ""no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days.""', 'Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, spoke for many in her party when, nearing the end of two days of testimony, she told Gorsuch: ""It remains to be seen whether you will be a justice for all or a justice for some.""', '———', 'Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this report.', '———', 'Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac', '———', ""Find AP's reporting on Neil Gorsuch here: http://apne.ws/2mfXk4V""]",0.0

'Boss Baby' Author Says Comparing Trump To Infant Character Makes Total Sense," Author Marla Frazee, author of The Boss Baby, has admitted the film was inspired by her beloved cartoon, which was voiced by Alec Baldwin in the film.","['“The Boss Baby”\xa0hit theaters late last month and surged to the top of box-office charts soon after. Not only has the animated film about a particularly high-handed infant dominated ticket sales, it’s managed to wiggle its way into headlines the way most news does these days: by relating to President Donald Trump.', '“Is ‘The Boss Baby’ Really a Cartoon About an Infant Donald Trump?” Vanity Fair asked. “The latest DreamWorks animation is the first movie to nod to Donald Trump’s childish antics,” The Guardian proclaimed. The parallel was clear. Critics couldn’t help themselves from comparing a dictatorial baby, serendipitously voiced by Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin, to our current commander in chief.', 'The story of an imperious, suit-wearing baby, who in the film seems to abhor happiness in the form of adorable puppies, actually began with Marla Frazee, the children’s book author who wrote and illustrated\xa0Boss Baby\xa0in 2010. What began with a sketch long hanging in her studio, based on a conversation she’d had about a friend’s problematic boss, morphed into a light-hearted picture book that, seven years later,\xa0is capturing the hearts of Trump dissenters.', 'Well, in an interview with The Huffington Post over the phone on Thursday, Frazee admitted the comparisons make a lot of sense:', 'When did you learn that DreamWorks wanted to turn The Boss Baby\xa0into a movie?\xa0', 'Right before Boss Baby was released in the fall of 2010, my agent Steve Malk received word from Damon Ross, who works at DreamWorks animation. Damon had seen the book and was interested in optioning it for a possible feature-length animated movie, which was incredibly exciting. Although it was tempered by what I knew, which was that many books are optioned and they never actually get made into movies. So I was cautiously excited, I guess.\xa0', 'What has your reaction to the film been like?', 'Oh, it’s just unbelievable. I was lucky enough to see the film in certain phases of its process over all these years, because DreamWorks has been very generous in inviting me to the studio to see things at various points. I saw it finished finished at the wrap party probably two weeks before it was released. I was just so blown away. The difference between it being almost finished to being finished was huge. It just came together in a way that was so much tighter, with the music. Things that I don’t really know how to describe, they offered a completely different experience than what I had seen before. I think it’s just been exciting, start to finish.', 'Did you ever imagine, while writing the book, that it would one day become the No. 1 film at the box office?', 'No. [Laughs] Not to put too fine a point on it, but no. I could not have imagined that. And not only that, but the synchronicity of the fact that, you know, where we are in terms of politics. We have the “Boss Baby” character being voiced by Alec Baldwin, who is impersonating Trump on “Saturday Night Live.” And Trump being in the Oval Office, acting like, many people think, the Boss Baby. So, it’s just a circular, incredible thing that’s not something that was planned.', 'Were you at all surprised by these comparisons between Boss Baby and Trump? Does it make sense to you?', 'In a strange way, yes, it does make sense to me. Saying that, it was completely surprising. Absolutely surprising. Part of what makes sense to me is that ― and I’ve thought about this quite a bit ― when I was writing the book and sort of envisioning this character, I thought of the Boss Baby character as a white, stereotypical male boss. Mainly because it was funnier. I couldn’t understand why it was funnier, but it was.', 'That’s the thing about stereotypes, they’re kind of hard to untangle. In order to riff on them, there has to be some sort of buy-in, that this is an absurd character. For me, when I was thinking about the book, I was reflecting on the sitcoms or TV shows of the ‘60s ― whether it was “The Dick Van Dyke Show” or “Father Knows Best.” I sort of set the book, in my head, not only in that time period but in that fictional TV world. And so when I first started doing the sketches, I had the book cover looking like a vintage TV screen, and I had Boss Baby walking into his house for the first time with a TV jingle kind of going on. There was a sort of artifice about the world it was set in.\xa0', 'For what we’re kind of living through now, the sense of what’s happening in the White House, there’s a lot of similarities there ― with the artifice of it.\xa0When Alec Baldwin started to be all over the place with his impression of Trump, it did seem like there were going to be all these connections that would be made. And they have been.\xa0', 'I believe it was Vulture who came down definitively on the comparison. [Emily Yoshida wrote an article titled “Stop Saying Every Piece of Art Is About Trump. Only Boss Baby Is About Trump.”]', 'It’s uncanny. I would say that.', 'You’ve mentioned that your book is based on your son’s reaction to a particularly havoc-wreaking new kitten in your home. Did you base Boss Baby’s experiences on your actual son or your life as a mother?', 'Absolutely, when I had my first son ― we have three and they’re now grown-ups ― but when I had the first baby, my predominant feeling was, “Why didn’t anyone tell me this was going to be so insane?” I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t warned. Then, when my youngest son was 15, he wanted a kitten for Christmas. So we went ahead and we got this little kitten. We had no idea what cats were capable of. The kitten was adorable, but it was pooping under our bed and under our Christmas tree and in the fireplace. My 15-year-old came up to me after about two weeks, really upset, and said, “I kind of think we should take this cat back to the cat adoption place.” I’m like, “Why?” “Because he’s stressing everybody out.” I said, “This is nothing! Nothing. You should have seen what it was like when you guys were babies. We’ll be fine. We’ll learn how to love this cat. Really. Trust me.”', 'But then I thought, you know, he’s sort of reacting the way new parents do ― the way I felt ― when babies come into your house and start bossing. They become the boss of you. They just come in and take over. So that feeling, somehow, watching [my son] experience it was a really instructive thing for me to see and channel. I don’t know if I would have launched off to work on the book with my own memories of watching it [...] It was a hard book to go from the concept of to anything that was working, more so than other book I had worked on.', 'Why do you think that is?', 'I wanted it to be funny, and funny books are hard. When I started, I had too many characters. There were friends and relatives who the baby had as part-time employees, there was a dog the baby fired. There was more. And I had to take a lot of that out. And maybe he wasn’t as abrasive as he needed to be. So to get some distance as him as a real baby and focus on him more as a crazy boss, that was a line that was a little tough to find.', 'What was it like, in turn, seeing this pared-down story turned into a feature-length film? Did the filmmakers incorporate some of the details you’d originally wanted to include?', 'A lot of them are there, and that has been interesting. I knew from the very beginning that this 32-page picture book being turned into a feature-length film was going to be a very different animal. It just is. I think what the book focuses on is when a baby comes into a family and really is the boss of the parents ― there are no siblings in the first book. [Editor’s Note: Frazee did write a second book, The Bossier Baby, last fall, in which the Boss Baby is demoted by little sister CEO.] But in the movie, [older brother] Tim Templeton is the unreliable narrator and so it is about his displacement.', 'But what I think is the same, is just how a baby just changes a family’s life. In the film, I was amazed by how a lot of the lines that are narrated by Toby Maguire as adult Tim Templeton are almost verbatim the text of the book. So it sets up the film and the memory almost line for line.\xa0', 'Obviously The\xa0Boss Baby is a children’s book and, now, a kid’s movie. But it’s doing very well, largely because, I would assume, adults also enjoy the story. As a writer of children’s stories, how do you balance the desire to make a plot resonate with kids, yet entertain adults, too?', 'For me, the reason I love doing picture books so much is that I know that the picture-book-aged child ― who is the audience for the book ― they are the best picture-readers of all of us. Once we learn how to read words, we sort of lose that ability to read the picture narrative as expertly as we do. I worry about how to keep their attention and not make mistakes, because they’ll find them if I put them in there by accident. Once I feel like I’ve locked that into place and it’s saying what I want it to, the words, for me, they accompany the pictures and hopefully bounce off of them in interesting ways that build to something more. I feel like I’m going to get the child reader with the picture story and keep the adult reader there with the words. But I’m not as interested in that as I am the picture-book-age child who’s going to read the book over and over again and live with it in a way an adult never will.', 'When you started out as an illustrator and author, were you influenced by any artists or writers who came before you?\xa0', 'So many. One of the books that made me want to grow up and do this was Where the Wild Things Are. Specifically, the place where Max’s room turns into a forest, just blew me away. I found it to be one of the most miraculous, magical things I had ever seen. I just wanted to learn how to do that ― that sort of page-turn magic. I was very much into the idea of becoming a children’s book author because of that book.', 'And the other book was Blueberries for Sal\xa0by Robert McCloskey, because I loved Sal so much. She was such a quirky, specific child, so much so that I wanted to be her. I didn’t just want to look at her in a book. I wished she was me and I was her. I felt so attached to her. Later, when I went to school and took art classes, and eventually went to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and studied illustration, I would always think about the way he drew her, which was so specific and detailed and so full of life.\xa0', 'This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\xa0', 'Share this slide:']",0.466666666619999

"Hair Loss, Warts, and Scars: Scientists ID the Facial Features Villains Have in Common [Video]"," People's skin is surprisingly complex, but some celebrities have skin conditions that people with similar body types don't, according to a simple theory from dermatologists.","['More', 'As a whole, movie villains have a certain look: They’re usually not as good-looking as the movie’s hero, and have certain\xa0physical features that make them seem\xa0more evil than other characters. When you see a villain onscreen, you know it.', 'But scientists decided to explore why we’re able to spot villains so clearly, and dove into the dermatologic features they have in common. The results were published online in the April 2017 journal of\xa0JAMA Dermatology. For the study, researchers took a look at the all-time top 10 film heroes and villains from the American Film Institute’s 100 Greatest Heroes and Villains List. Villains included Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs), Mr. Potter (It’s a Wonderful Life), Darth Vader (The Empire Strikes Back), the Queen (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Regan MacNeil (The Exorcist), and the Wicked Witch of the West (The Wizard of Oz). They then analyzed dermatologic characteristics of each and looked for patterns.', 'Here’s what they found: Six of the top 10 villains have distinct dermatologic features. They included:', 'Six of the villains studied had some kind of dermatologic condition on their faces, but only two film heroes did. Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Rick Blaine in Casablanca had facial scars, but the study’s authors noted that “heroic” facial scars are usually more subtle and smaller than those of their villainous counterparts.', 'But those “villainous” dermatological conditions are also fairly common in real-life\xa0people. “It is unfortunate that skin conditions are villainized, but it demonstrates the significant psychosocial impact they have on patients and the importance of good treatments,” Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist, tells Yahoo Beauty.', 'Some of the conditions — such as\xa0wrinkles and dark under-eye circles\xa0—\xa0are common but more often associated with advanced age, poor health, and nutrition, Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells Yahoo Beauty.', 'The good news: If you have one of these skin conditions and wish you didn’t, you should know that they are often treatable. Hair loss can be treated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, oral medication, Rogaine, and hair transplant procedures, Goldenberg says. You can reduce wrinkles with options such as\xa0Botox, fillers, laser resurfacing, and microneedling — a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation procedure that uses fine needles to puncture the skin to create a controlled skin injury that stimulates collagen production — according to Goldenberg.', 'There are several causes of dark under-eye circles, Zeichner notes, including having thin, pale skin, and a loss of facial volume. “Collagen-stimulating eye creams to strengthen the skin, combined with antioxidant eye creams to brighten, are key components to improving the skin,” he says, adding that vitamin K can also lighten\xa0the area under a person’s eyes. And, if you visit a dermatologist, he or she can use injectable hyaluronic acid fillers to boost facial volume and mask under-eye bags, Zeichner says.', 'Scars are pretty common, but Zeichner says their appearance can be minimized by over-the-counter silicone gels and sheets that protect, hydrate, soften, and stimulate healthy collagen production in the scar. A dermatologist can also use lasers to reduce redness and improve the texture of the scars, he says.', 'As for warts, Zeichner says they can be easily treated with a variety of topical agents, such as\xa0salicylic acid, which sloughs off the growth.\xa0A dermatologist can also freeze a wart off for you — just know that you may need patience. “Unfortunately, warts are tough to treat, and often need repeated treatments months after month,” Zeichner says.', 'If you have a “villainous” dermatologic condition and it bothers you, don’t be a hero — talk to your dermatologist about your options.

Clayton told CBS 4 Indianapolis that his wife initially started making blankets with a camping club, which would donate them to different organizations in the area. As the years went on, however, it became an activity that the couple could enjoy together — with one key distinction.', '“She was the seamstress,” he said. “I was never a seamstress. This is a new ballgame because I was always an outside person.”', 'In his wife’s absence, Clayton has found himself with the time and resources to continue the charitable activity on his own.

I can do this when it’s raining outside and I enjoy doing it. I’m sure if my wife was here she would be happy I’m doing this too.”', 'In deciding what to do with the blankets when they’re done, Shelburne was particularly moved by a story about a father leaving his sleeping son in a vehicle along the highway while he went to get help with their broken-down car. It inspired him to help police in his county. So, he has now donated enough blankets to the Zionsville Police Department and the Boone County Sheriff’s Office that every patrol car can have one.', '“We could show up to a crash and the weather could be like it is now where it’s nice and cold and that blanket will come in real handy when you wrap it around somebody in need,” said Sgt. Adrian Martin of the Zionsville Police Department.', 'He’s given the officers more than three dozen homemade blankets so far.', '“For an individual, a civilian for that matter, to take it upon themselves to not only to take their time and invest their money and their personal stake into a product or event that benefits any law enforcement agency, particularly Zionsville, we appreciate that,” Martin said.', 'Now that he’s fully stocked the local police, Shelburne is turning his attention to the Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis — further ensuring that his warm memories of his wife become a source of warmth for others as well.']",0.13333333332
