Security Council called to review what the Trump administration calls its most dire national security concern. “The more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it.”', 'Tillerson’s push at a special session of the Security Council came as the Trump administration said it is willing to bargain directly with North Korea over ending its nuclear weapons program, but under strict conditions that make talks unlikely anytime soon.', 'Ahead of the diplomatic effort at the United Nations, President Trump said direct conflict is possible. “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an interview this week. “We’d love to solve things diplomatically, but it’s very difficult.”', 'Hours after the U.N. meeting, North Korea fired another missile early Saturday local time, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Cmdr.

The launch underscored North Korea’s determination to show its defiance of international pressure.', 'Trump took to Twitter to reiterate his expectation that Chinese President Xi Jinping will use his leverage to make North Korea stop its weapons activities.', '“North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” Trump tweeted.', 'In the most-detailed explanation to date of the Trump administration’s emerging policy for dealing with North Korea, Tillerson told the Security Council on Friday that U.S. urgency is driven by the current nuclear threat to allies South Korea and Japan as well as the likelihood that North Korea will soon be able to strike the United States.', '“All options for responding to future provocation must remain on the table. Diplomatic and financial levers of power will be backed up by a willingness to counteract North Korean aggression with military action if necessary,” Tillerson said.', '“We much prefer a negotiated solution to this problem,” he added. “But we are committed to defending ourselves and our allies against North Korean aggression.”', 'The effect of both Trump’s and Tillerson’s remarks is to present a willingness to negotiate with North Korea that surprised and pleased diplomats the United States needs for any new joint effort at the United Nations or elsewhere.

After he departed Morgan Stanley for Goldman Sachs in late 2015, the buzz among his new colleagues -- and rivals -- was all about the fate of the distressed book he left behind, according to people who have worked or traded with him. The bank’s distressed bets helped contribute to a 42 percent decline in third-quarter bond-trading revenue that year, the people said, a tumultuous period that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman called the worst for fixed income at the firm since he took the top job in 2010. Savarese left just months before Gorman fired 25 percent of fixed-income traders and salespeople.', 'He landed at Goldman Sachs, where his older brother Jason is co-chief operating officer of the securities division, which houses the trading units, including the distressed-debt desk. Adam joined as a partner, one of the few people the bank has hired from a competitor at that level.', 'At the time, Goldman Sachs’s distressed-debt desk was in turmoil. Jerry Keefe and Dennis Lafferty, who had been co-heads of the group with Tom Tormey, both left after Tormey was elevated to partner. Keefe joined hedge fund CarVal Investors and Lafferty departed for HSBC Holdings Plc. Some time later, Tormey moved into a different role and handed oversight to Savarese.', 'In 2016, spurred by the Peabody bet, as well as a position in Ultra Petroleum Corp., his team brought in more than $200 million in revenue, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

"‘Wonder Woman,’ ‘Spider-Man’ and How Trailers Push the Familiar "," This week, the Times is telling you all the basics behind some other popular superhero leads, and which ones to pay closer attention to..","['The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.', 'At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.', 'Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.', 'Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.', 'The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.', 'The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.', 'Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.', 'Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.', 'In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.', 'Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”', 'That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.', 'As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.', 'Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.', 'If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.', 'Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.', 'One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.', 'There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I.']"

Macron’s rise shows that extremism – whether left or right – is not inevitable, Commentateur and columnist Loi-vul Anybody?-;,"['George Orwell once wrote that the British were not sufficiently interested in intellectual matters to be intolerant about them. The French, on the other hand, enjoy nothing less than a high-minded, lofty debate over abstract concepts – or so it is believed. The British ask: “It works in theory, but does it work in practice?” The French ask: “It works in practice, but does it work in theory?” So the joke goes.', 'As a London-based French citizen watching my own country heading for a rancourous presidential runoff on 7 May and Britain preparing for its first post-Brexit general election, I’m not sure the supposed differences between us are as marked as we like to think. And I see lessons for the UK from what is happening across the Channel.', 'While you struggle to make sense of Brexit, we’re struggling with the looming catastrophe that would be the election of Marine Le Pen. And up against her in the second round, the 39-year-old centrist reformer, Emmanuel Macron, is our new national sensation. He wants to abolish the once watertight left-right divide, upending decades of ideological confrontation.', 'He’s no Robespierre. He quoted Albert Camus in one of his rallies earlier this month: “Each generation no doubt believes it is doomed to remake the world. The task of our generation may be even larger: it consists in preventing the world from coming undone.” So, not entirely unBritish.', 'This is not a perfect parallel. Though withdrawal from the EU is sad and costly, it’s unlikely to unravel British democracy. By contrast, the victory of a far-right leader in France would be the death of all the values the republic is meant to uphold. Brexit may be troublesome for EU citizens living in the UK – and there have even been several xenophobic attacks since 23 June – but a Le Pen win would put 7 million or so French nationals of African, Arabic or Muslim descent under constant physical threat. The bigotry that pervades her rallies would be unleashed nationwide. The country’s fragile social fabric, which terrorism has already torn at, would be ripped apart entirely.', 'If the polls are right, Macron should win. He hasn’t yet. But if his rise has proved something the British might do well to heed, it is that a robust political centre does have a chance against rightwing populism. The centre is not ineffective, and it’s not outdated. The old structures may crumble – and indeed the traditional postwar parties in France are all but wiped out – but that does not mean the extreme parts of the political spectrum will be the only ones to grow out of the ruins.', 'Radical rightwing politics has thrived by exploiting the popular rage that characterises the mood in France today (fuelled by joblessness and deep distrust of the elites). Nearly 50% of the electorate voted on 23 April for either the far left, the far right, or Trotskyist and maverick candidates. But so far, even against that sorry backdrop, a clearsighted, energetic Macron has come out on top.', 'He calls himself “progressive”, and stands for social liberalism, or pro-market social democracy. He’s not anti-capitalist nor anti-globalisation, and certainly not nativist. He’s the anti-radical who advocates step-by-step, moderate reform to heal the many fractures of an extremely tense and anxious country. He doesn’t want to pitch social classes or ethnic groups against one another. His is a slow-motion revolution, and that’s something utterly new by French standards. Indeed, he’s more interested in what works in practice than in what might look good in theory. That may seem familiar to you Brits.', 'It’s an approach that could strike a chord across a continent that sees nationalism reawakened, along with its ghosts. Le Pen embodies that rising nationalism in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, the Jarosław Kascyński crowd in Poland. Brexit can be interpreted as a kind of nationalist resurgence. Witness Theresa May’s observation this week that 27 European countries are “lining up against” Britain. How often has a siege mentality tactic been deployed by illiberal politicians to galvanise the populists, with no regard for the consequences?', 'Macron’s ascendency could encourage those in Britain who would like to see another path open up. One that would help counter the kind of narrative deployed by May; one that could soften Brexit. A left-leaning Labour offers little solace in that regard. The best antidote seems to be a confident centre, one built on pragmatic, moral, optimistic beliefs, and, as we see in France, rich in potential. If Macron prevails on 7 May, the immediate effect of his centre revolution will probably be felt in France. But its most important effect should be to galvanise like minds abroad, and certainly here.']"

He also tossed 30 touchdowns against six interceptions. While those numbers aren't shabby, the reason why this junior standout has a shot at coming off the board first is his polish. There isn't much tape on the Ohio native, but he's shown the ability to make every throw and has a natural feel for the game. Trubisky's instincts are on point and he has what it takes to develop into a great quarterback at the professional level."", 'With signal-callers generally being hit-or-miss in the draft, even in the early rounds, Trubisky is the safest option at the position in 2017. That alone makes him more attractive to an organization like the Browns, which will have to shell out approximately $30.3 million with over $20 million as a signing bonus if they take the UNC product at No. 1.', ' North Carolina quarterback Mitch Trubisky (10) runs the ball during the first quarter of an NCAA college football game against Illinois, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016 at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Ill.

If Trubisky ends up being the pick and pans out, that $30.3M million will be a great value for a player who could generate hype around a young team, subsequently putting fans in the seats and making merchandise fly off the shelf.', ""However, there are other intriguing options for Cleveland, including star defender Myles Garrett, and there is a decent chance the team goes in that direction. If that is the case, Trubisky stands to lose millions. Oddsmakers currently have the over/under on Trubisky's draft position set at 9.5, with a 68.5% chance of him being selected from No. 1 to No. 9 and 31.5% odds that he is picked at No. 10 or beyond. Should he fall to the Buffalo Bills at No. 10 a realistic landing spot Trubisky's deal would be valued at $16.4M, nearly $14 million less than he could make in Cleveland."", ""The latest Trubisky realistically comes off the board is No. 12, where the Browns own a second first-rounder by way of the Philadelphia Eagles. In an ideal world for Cleveland, the front office would be able to hedge the risk of selecting Trubisky by nabbing him at this draft slot. In this scenario, the team could take a much surer prospect at No. 1 such as Garrett and give him the big payday that comes with that honor. The Tar Heels QB would still be on the roster for the 2017 campaign, but at a vastly reduced price tag. The No. 12 draft pick this year will earn approximately $13.8M, with an $8.2 signing bonus making up the majority of that deal. That has to be a much more palatable situation for the team, especially considering Trubisky's lack of experience."", ' Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is seen before a drill at the 2017 NFL football scouting combine Sunday, March 5, 2017, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Gregory Payan)', ""Garrett is a generational, slam-dunk talent that figures to be heavily if not leading the discussions in the Browns' war room on Thursday night. The Aggies star is arguably the top overall talent in the draft and projects to make an immediate impact wherever he lands. He's elite at getting after the quarterback and has what it takes to hang as a run-stuffer although there is room for improvement there. A minute of tape will tell you that this guy has all the skills of an NFL superstar, as well as a humble attitude and willingness to improve that franchises covet. While Garrett won't impact the game as much as a superstar quarterback could, the odds of him paying dividends on a $30+ million rookie contract are much higher than Trubisky."", ""Regardless of what happens on Thursday night, Trubisky, Garrett and the rest of the first-rounders are poised to become quite rich.

But he brushed off security concerns by driving into town with his windows rolled down in a simple blue Fiat — not the armored ""popemobiles"" of his predecessors.', ""Francis' first event was a landmark visit to Cairo's Al Azhar university, the revered, 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Islam learning that trains clerics and scholars from around the world."", ""There, he warmly embraced Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Al-Azhar's grand imam who hosted the pope and other senior Muslim and Christian leaders at a peace conference."", 'Speaking to the crowd, Francis recalled that Egypt\'s ancient civilizations valued the quest for knowledge and open-minded education, and that a similar commitment is required today to combat the ""barbarity"" of religious extremism among the young.', ""While Al-Azhar has strongly condemned Islamic fundamentalism, Egypt's pro-government media has accused its leadership of failing to do enough to reform the religious discourse in Islam and purge canonical books from outdated teachings and hatred for non-Muslims."", '""As religious leaders, we are called to unmask violence that masquerades as purported sanctity,"" Francis said to applause from the crowd.

Security men, meanwhile, were posted every hundred meters (yards) or so along the 20-kilometer (12-mile) stretch between the airport and central Cairo ahead of Francis' arrival and armored cars were stationed in front of the presidential palace."", ""The pope's visit, however, is unlikely to cause much disruption to the city of some 18 million people as it falls on the Muslim Friday-Saturday weekend, when the usually congested traffic is significantly lighter."", '___', 'Associated Press Writer Hamza Hendawi in Cairo contributed to this report.']"
