People who\xa0work reduced schedules might earn\xa0a reduced salary.\xa0 \xa0Under the program, employees such as Sanchez don't have to stress about asking\xa0for a flexible arrangement—or the guilt or stigma that might bring.

Security Council called to review what the Trump administration calls its most dire national security concern. “The more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it.”', 'Tillerson’s push at a special session of the Security Council came as the Trump administration said it is willing to bargain directly with North Korea over ending its nuclear weapons program, but under strict conditions that make talks unlikely anytime soon.', 'Ahead of the diplomatic effort at the United Nations, President Trump said direct conflict is possible. “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an interview this week. “We’d love to solve things diplomatically, but it’s very difficult.”', 'Hours after the U.N. meeting, North Korea fired another missile early Saturday local time, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Cmdr. Dave Benham said in a statement. The launch underscored North Korea’s determination to show its defiance of international pressure.', 'Trump took to Twitter to reiterate his expectation that Chinese President Xi Jinping will use his leverage to make North Korea stop its weapons activities.', '“North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” Trump tweeted.', 'In the most-detailed explanation to date of the Trump administration’s emerging policy for dealing with North Korea, Tillerson told the Security Council on Friday that U.S. urgency is driven by the current nuclear threat to allies South Korea and Japan as well as the likelihood that North Korea will soon be able to strike the United States.', '“All options for responding to future provocation must remain on the table. Diplomatic and financial levers of power will be backed up by a willingness to counteract North Korean aggression with military action if necessary,” Tillerson said.', '“We much prefer a negotiated solution to this problem,” he added. “But we are committed to defending ourselves and our allies against North Korean aggression.”', 'The effect of both Trump’s and Tillerson’s remarks is to present a willingness to negotiate with North Korea that surprised and pleased diplomats the United States needs for any new joint effort at the United Nations or elsewhere.

Security Council session Friday comes at a particularly tense time in relations between North Korea and the United States, with the Trump administration sending warships to the region in a show of force against Kim’s regime.', 'This week, North Korea conducted large-scale artillery drills, showing off conventional weaponry that can easily reach South Korea’s capital, Seoul, the center of a metropolitan region of about 25\xa0million people.', 'A North Korean propaganda outlet released a video clip Thursday showing a simulated attack on the White House and declaring that the ability to destroy the United States “is in our sights.”', '“North Korea must understand that respect will never follow recklessness,” Tillerson said Friday. “North Korea must take concrete steps to reduce the threat that its illegal weapons programs pose to the United States and our allies before we can consider talks.”', 'The last round of direct talks, initiated in 2003 and involving the United States, China and other nations, produced no rollback of the North Korean program.

Savarese snagged its unsecured bonds for pennies on the dollar and rode them up for one of 2016’s most successful trades, according to people familiar with the desk and its wagers. It was risky: Some peers at other banks played it safer with secured bonds, which offered greater protection, though a smaller upside.\xa0But Savarese’s blockbuster Peabody move helped engineer a rebound on a desk\xa0buffeted by losses and the departure of senior leaders.', 'Now that same rescue play is inflicting pain. Though the trade is still a winner over its lifetime, it reversed course in the first quarter to contribute to a fixed-income trading performance at Goldman Sachs that was so unexpectedly soft that the stock tumbled as much as 5.8 percent on April 18. While currencies and commodities trading left an even bigger dent, the performance by Savarese -- and the bank’s entire credit desk -- has attracted attention because it contrasts with better results at rivals.', 'Savarese’s is a familiar tale in the business, where you can be riding high one minute and humbled the next.\xa0If the 39-year-old sold or reduced his holding in December, he could’ve locked in gains.

"‘Wonder Woman,’ ‘Spider-Man’ and How Trailers Push the Familiar "," Some key details about “Wonder Woman,” the film set to get a big US release this summer. because we are here to contribute.'"" more","['The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.', 'At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.', 'Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.', 'Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.', 'The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.', 'The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.', 'Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.', 'Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.', 'In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.', 'Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”', 'That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.', 'As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.', 'Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.', 'If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.', 'Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.', 'One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.', 'There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I.']"

Macron’s rise shows that extremism – whether left or right – is not inevitable," The French magazine L'affaires (the Alternative) has written an article on why it thinks France's presidential election will be a ""referendum"" between left and right - an apparent reference to Britain's impending ballot on European Union","['George Orwell once wrote that the British were not sufficiently interested in intellectual matters to be intolerant about them. The French, on the other hand, enjoy nothing less than a high-minded, lofty debate over abstract concepts – or so it is believed. The British ask: “It works in theory, but does it work in practice?” The French ask: “It works in practice, but does it work in theory?” So the joke goes.', 'As a London-based French citizen watching my own country heading for a rancourous presidential runoff on 7 May and Britain preparing for its first post-Brexit general election, I’m not sure the supposed differences between us are as marked as we like to think. And I see lessons for the UK from what is happening across the Channel.', 'While you struggle to make sense of Brexit, we’re struggling with the looming catastrophe that would be the election of Marine Le Pen. And up against her in the second round, the 39-year-old centrist reformer, Emmanuel Macron, is our new national sensation. He wants to abolish the once watertight left-right divide, upending decades of ideological confrontation.', 'He’s no Robespierre. He quoted Albert Camus in one of his rallies earlier this month: “Each generation no doubt believes it is doomed to remake the world. The task of our generation may be even larger: it consists in preventing the world from coming undone.” So, not entirely unBritish.', 'This is not a perfect parallel. Though withdrawal from the EU is sad and costly, it’s unlikely to unravel British democracy. By contrast, the victory of a far-right leader in France would be the death of all the values the republic is meant to uphold. Brexit may be troublesome for EU citizens living in the UK – and there have even been several xenophobic attacks since 23 June – but a Le Pen win would put 7 million or so French nationals of African, Arabic or Muslim descent under constant physical threat. The bigotry that pervades her rallies would be unleashed nationwide. The country’s fragile social fabric, which terrorism has already torn at, would be ripped apart entirely.', 'If the polls are right, Macron should win. He hasn’t yet. But if his rise has proved something the British might do well to heed, it is that a robust political centre does have a chance against rightwing populism. The centre is not ineffective, and it’s not outdated. The old structures may crumble – and indeed the traditional postwar parties in France are all but wiped out – but that does not mean the extreme parts of the political spectrum will be the only ones to grow out of the ruins.', 'Radical rightwing politics has thrived by exploiting the popular rage that characterises the mood in France today (fuelled by joblessness and deep distrust of the elites). Nearly 50% of the electorate voted on 23 April for either the far left, the far right, or Trotskyist and maverick candidates. But so far, even against that sorry backdrop, a clearsighted, energetic Macron has come out on top.', 'He calls himself “progressive”, and stands for social liberalism, or pro-market social democracy. He’s not anti-capitalist nor anti-globalisation, and certainly not nativist. He’s the anti-radical who advocates step-by-step, moderate reform to heal the many fractures of an extremely tense and anxious country. He doesn’t want to pitch social classes or ethnic groups against one another. His is a slow-motion revolution, and that’s something utterly new by French standards. Indeed, he’s more interested in what works in practice than in what might look good in theory. That may seem familiar to you Brits.', 'It’s an approach that could strike a chord across a continent that sees nationalism reawakened, along with its ghosts. Le Pen embodies that rising nationalism in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, the Jarosław Kascyński crowd in Poland. Brexit can be interpreted as a kind of nationalist resurgence. Witness Theresa May’s observation this week that 27 European countries are “lining up against” Britain. How often has a siege mentality tactic been deployed by illiberal politicians to galvanise the populists, with no regard for the consequences?', 'Macron’s ascendency could encourage those in Britain who would like to see another path open up. One that would help counter the kind of narrative deployed by May; one that could soften Brexit. A left-leaning Labour offers little solace in that regard. The best antidote seems to be a confident centre, one built on pragmatic, moral, optimistic beliefs, and, as we see in France, rich in potential. If Macron prevails on 7 May, the immediate effect of his centre revolution will probably be felt in France. But its most important effect should be to galvanise like minds abroad, and certainly here.']"

In an ideal world for Cleveland, the front office would be able to hedge the risk of selecting Trubisky by nabbing him at this draft slot. In this scenario, the team could take a much surer prospect at No. 1 such as Garrett and give him the big payday that comes with that honor. The Tar Heels QB would still be on the roster for the 2017 campaign, but at a vastly reduced price tag. The No. 12 draft pick this year will earn approximately $13.8M, with an $8.2 signing bonus making up the majority of that deal. That has to be a much more palatable situation for the team, especially considering Trubisky's lack of experience."", ' Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is seen before a drill at the 2017 NFL football scouting combine Sunday, March 5, 2017, in Indianapolis.

The Aggies star is arguably the top overall talent in the draft and projects to make an immediate impact wherever he lands. He's elite at getting after the quarterback and has what it takes to hang as a run-stuffer although there is room for improvement there. A minute of tape will tell you that this guy has all the skills of an NFL superstar, as well as a humble attitude and willingness to improve that franchises covet. While Garrett won't impact the game as much as a superstar quarterback could, the odds of him paying dividends on a $30+ million rookie contract are much higher than Trubisky."", ""Regardless of what happens on Thursday night, Trubisky, Garrett and the rest of the first-rounders are poised to become quite rich. Just how rich remains to be seen, but it's going to be very interesting to see how these fortunes are divvied out.""]"

No state has more EB-5 visa recipients than California. Yet, in February, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein said that wasn't good enough. American needed to open its doors to others instead. She was quoted by NBC news saying EB-5 was selling U.S. citizenship while millions wait in line for visas. EB-5 is a tiny portion of the U.S. immigration total."", ""The most powerful legislator on this issue, though, is Grassley. He also wants to see the program gutted. He is giving the industry a starting position of roughly $1.2 million as a minimum investment. The regional centers hate this proposal, saying it would turn off thousands of investors and stop projects currently on paper. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service has proposed regulations for even higher minimums, now at $1.3 million. EB-5 will eventually be changed to fit these new guidelines. Friday's extension gives Grassley more time to negotiate with the industry. His former staffer, Kathy Nuebel-Kovarik, is a policy director now at USCIS, giving Grassley's proposals an upper hand."", ""But Grassley's rule changes, assuming they ultimately bring the minimum up to a more palpable $800 million as the market expects, are not a deal breaker."", 'Some of the proposals include setting aside visas for projects for infrastructure, distressed assets in non-target zones, and rural development. Chinese investors have tended to pump money into mixed used real estate in cities where they want to live. But investments into rural infrastructure, for instance, like dams and river ports, would not force those investors to live in those areas. They can live wherever the want. The problem for the developer of mixed use real estate, however, is that if more of the visas are required to focus on non-core cities and states, they will have a harder time convincing foreign buyers to move into a new Oklahoma City high rise.', 'Opponents of the visa like Feinstein point out a handful of fraud cases where small companies or individuals created real estate projects, lured immigrants on the EB-5, got their money and disappeared.', ' FBI agents inspect the offices of the California Investment Immigration Fund after serving search warrants in an investigation into an alleged $50 million high-end visa fraud scheme involving as many as 100 Chinese nationals in San Gabriel, California on April 5, 2017.

There is an emotional reaction against this program because it is an immigrant-based program, says Samar Ali, an attorney specializing in EB-5 cases at Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville.', 'Trump says he is in favor of a merit-based immigration system, while Feinstein is laser focused on refugees. If open border Democrats lumped changes to the EB-5 visa program with a broader immigration reform bill down the road, it could face its D-day once more.', ""I'm not so sure Trump meddles with it, says Roger Bernstein, an EB-5 project manager and owner of the EB-5 for Florida Regional Center. Bernstein said that the Trump family was involved in an EB-5 deal in New Jersey. Jared Kushner built the 50-story Trump Bay Street tower with Chinese investors looking for citizenship."", 'These are wealthy immigrants sending their kids to private schools and are not a drain on public services, if that is a concern, says Bernstein.

Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared?', 'Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing “the Wall,” no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and his Supreme Court appointment. “Hitting it out of the ballpark,” said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts.', 'Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. “When I get up in the morning, I think, ‘Well, what did Trump do now?’” said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office.', 'And then there are those somewhere in between. Some who were reluctant in November say they are happy with a growing economy and his support for the military.

Still, Mr. Exner was hard pressed to name more than a few accomplishments.

She said the other day that she did not declare her support for him until Nov. 8, Election Day, when she cast her ballot.

His complaints came on the heels of the appeals court earlier this year helping block his controversial “travel ban” and a federal District Court judge in northern California on Tuesday blocking his bid to cut off sanctuary city funding.', 'That judge, William Orrick, is not on the 9th Circuit bench, but the case could hit that court if appealed.', 'Trump accused his opponents of “judge shopping,” and told the Examiner they “immediately run to the 9th Circuit.”', 'And he gave a nod to congressional proposals to split up the appeals court into smaller parts.', '""There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It\'s outrageous,"" Trump said.', 'Republicans have long complained that the 9th Circuit is not only liberal-leaning but far too big – covering a sprawling amount of territory.', 'GOP Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona introduced legislation earlier this year to carve six states out of the court circuit and create a brand new 12th Circuit.', 'If they succeed, only California, Oregon, Hawaii and two island districts would remain in the 9th.', 'Under Flake’s bill, the new circuit would cover Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona and Alaska.', 'Congress created the court in 1891. At the time, the area was sparsely inhabited – only 4 percent of the U.S. population lived in the area compared to today’s 20 percent.', 'In 1998, Congress appointed a commission to re-examine the federal appeals courts’ structure.

The Drumbeats Don’t Add Up to Imminent War With North Korea ," The Washington Post's Alyssa Rosenberg assesses Trump administration moves, the recent rhetoric from North Korea and what looks like an immediate military contingency.","['WASHINGTON — President Trump summoned all 100 members of the Senate for a briefing by his war cabinet on the mounting tensions with North Korea. An American submarine loaded with Tomahawk missiles surfaced in a port in South Korea. Gas stations in the North shut down amid rumors that the government was stockpiling fuel.', 'Americans could be forgiven for thinking that war is about to break out. But it is not.', 'The drumbeat of bellicose threats and military muscle-flexing on both sides overstates the danger of a clash between the United States and North Korea, senior Trump administration officials and experts who have followed the Korean crisis for decades said. While Mr. Trump regards the rogue government in the North as his most pressing international problem, he told the senators he was pursuing a strategy that relied heavily on using China’s economic leverage to curb its neighbor’s provocative behavior.', 'Recent American military moves — like deploying the submarine Michigan and the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the waters off the Korean Peninsula — were aimed less at preparing for a pre-emptive strike, officials said, than at discouraging the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, from conducting further nuclear or ballistic missile tests.', '“In confronting the reckless North Korean regime, it’s critical that we’re guided by a strong sense of resolve, both privately and publicly, both diplomatically and militarily,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pentagon’s top commander in the Pacific, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.', '“We want to bring Kim Jong-un to his senses,” he said, “not to his knees.”', 'There are other signs that the tensions fall short of war. Mr. Kim continues to appear in public, most recently at a pig farm last weekend. South Koreans are not flooding supermarkets to stock up on food. There is no talk of evacuating cities and no sign the United States is deploying additional forces to South Korea. Nor is the American Embassy in Seoul advising diplomats’ families to leave the country.', 'All those things happened in the spring of 1994, when President Bill Clinton was considering a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean reactor to prevent the North from extracting plutonium that it could use to make a bomb. That is the closest the United States has come to a military clash with North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.', '“The reality is not as tense as the rhetoric on both sides would lead you to believe,” said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.', 'None of this is to say there is no risk of miscalculation that could escalate into hostilities. Mr. Trump’s penchant for provocative statements introduced an element of unpredictability to a relationship in which the uncertainty has historically been on the North Korean side. How Mr. Kim reacts is the major variable in a complicated equation.', 'North Korea is also steadily adding to its nuclear arsenal and edging closer to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile, tipped with a warhead, that could hit the United States. Intelligence estimates vary on how quickly that could happen, but some say within three years: a timetable that would put a successful test within Mr. Trump’s term in office.', '“No previous president has ever been in that situation,” said Victor D. Cha, director of the Asian studies program at Georgetown University, who advised the administration of George W. Bush on North Korea. “I don’t think we’re going to war, but we’re in a different phase.”', 'Mr. Cha said he viewed the briefing for senators as part of an effort by the White House to signal the seriousness of North Korea to an American public that regards it as a distant, complicated issue. But others criticized the president for being theatrical, with some saying he was using the senators as a prop to burnish his 100-day record.', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', '“There was very little, if anything, new,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “It is still unclear what our strategy and policy is.”', 'Even some Republican senators complained afterward that they had learned little and wondered why they needed to pile into buses for the trip from Capitol Hill to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House grounds, where they were seated in an auditorium.', '“I’m not sure I would have done it,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He said he was not sure why the briefing had been timed for this week and begged off further comment, adding, “All I can say is, it was fine.”', 'White House officials said they had been responding to a request from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and that Mr. Trump had proposed moving the site of the briefing. He spoke to the senators for less than three minutes, mainly promoting his efforts to persuade President Xi Jinping of China to put more economic pressure on North Korea.', 'Mr. Trump then turned the briefing over to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr.', 'Analysts said it was too early to assess Mr. Trump’s claim that the Chinese were finally cooperating with the United States. Previous presidents believed they had made headway with Beijing, only to have China’s actions fall short of expectations.', 'The reports of closed gas stations in North Korea were intriguing, analysts said, because they suggested that the North was bracing for a suspension of fuel shipments from China. The Chinese have yet to take such a step, though they have curtailed purchases of North Korean coal.', 'In a separate briefing for reporters, the White House said Mr. Trump had decided on a strategy that would include diplomacy to persuade China to keep up pressure on its neighbor, as well as military preparations.', 'A senior White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the nature of the military preparations or the timetable for seeing a change in North Korea’s behavior. He also said the administration was considering returning North Korea to the government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.', 'On Thursday morning, the National Security Council will hold a principals committee meeting to weigh economic and military options.', 'Admiral Harris told lawmakers that North Korea’s recent setbacks in its missile launches would not slow the country’s efforts to achieve its nuclear goals.', '“With every test, Kim Jong-un moves closer to his stated goal of a pre-emptive nuclear strike capability against American cities, and he’s not afraid to fail in public,” he told the House Armed Services Committee in a hearing on security challenges in the region.', 'Admiral Harris welcomed China’s role in influencing the North, but also singled it out for criticism. “While recent actions by Beijing are encouraging and welcome, the fact remains that China is as responsible for where North Korea is today as North Korea itself,” he said.']"

United Takes Added Steps to Win Back Customers and Avoid More Ugly Events , A round-up of the week's stories from around the web. by Taboola,"['United Airlines, still trying to regain its footing more than two weeks after a video showed a police officer violently dragging a passenger off a plane, on Thursday provided its fullest account yet of the episode and announced a series of steps meant to keep such an event from happening again.', 'The measures include new limits on when passengers can be removed from planes and much greater financial incentives — up to $10,000 in travel certificates — for those who volunteer to change flights.', 'In a report detailing its findings about the April 9 episode, United apologized again for the events involving the passenger, Dr. David Dao, who sustained a concussion and a broken nose and lost two teeth, according to his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio.', 'The airline also promised to introduce several other changes to its booking and boarding procedures later this year.', 'United said that passengers who have boarded flights should never have to give up their seats, except for safety or security problems. The airline also said that it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from its planes over booking issues and that all crew members traveling to other flight assignments would be booked into seats at least an hour before departure, two changes it had announced previously.', 'United said it would also create a new automated check-in process that gives customers a chance to express their willingness to relinquish their seats in exchange for compensation. And starting on Friday, United will increase the maximum sum offered to passengers who voluntarily give up their seats to $10,000 from the $1,350 cap that most airlines use.', 'In raising the cap, United is following the lead of Delta Air Lines, which announced on April 14 that its supervisors could offer up to $9,950 in compensation to passengers who voluntarily gave up their seats. Industry officials said that compensation offers would still start at a few hundred dollars, and that payments close to the new caps were likely to be rare.', 'Security officers dragged Dr. Dao off a United plane in Chicago to make room for an airline employee trying to get to work in another city. The episode has been a public relations disaster, pushing United to undertake a broad examination of how it treats customers.', '“Our goal is to reduce incidents of involuntary denial of boarding to as close to zero as possible and become a more customer-focused airline,” the airline said in the report.', 'United also plans to reduce how much it overbooks some flights and to create a special call-center team that can come up with solutions for overbooking problems. Maggie Schmerin, a United spokeswoman, said that rather than simply trying to switch passengers onto other flights to their destinations, the airline could fly travelers to nearby airports and pay for car services to take them the rest of the way.', 'In a further bid to regain its customers’ faith, United said it would address another cause of frustration among passengers — compensation for lost baggage — that is unrelated to the episode involving Dr. Dao. According to the report, United will pay customers $1,500, no questions asked, if it loses their bags. Customers whose baggage is worth more than that can still file for additional compensation, the airline said.', 'Here is what happens when people fly more often, in fuller planes and pay higher fees.', 'The changes United is making now “are steps in the right direction,” said Douglas G. Kidd, executive director of the National Association of Airline Passengers in Vienna, Va. But, he said, “Someone could have just used their head with Dr. Dao and said, ‘If you’re a doctor, and you need to see patients the next day, let me see if we can find somebody else.’”', 'Mr. Demetrio, Dr. Dao’s lawyer, said that he and his client both thought that United’s plans represented “an excellent start in a short period of time” toward solving the problems that passengers face with many airlines. He said he hoped that expanded training for United employees would include “how to defuse the situation instead of throwing gasoline on it.”', 'The episode involving Dr. Dao has also upended United’s top leadership ranks. The company’s board decided on Friday that the chief executive, Oscar Munoz, would not ascend as planned to the role of chairman. The board is also adjusting its incentive compensation program for senior executives to make it “directly and meaningfully tied to progress in improving the customer experience.”', 'Shortly after the episode, Mr. Munoz appeared to blame Dr. Dao for causing the problems. But Mr. Munoz soon reversed himself, apologizing repeatedly to Dr. Dao and saying he felt “shame” over how the situation had been handled.', 'Mr. Munoz, in a statement released on Thursday with the report, said he realized that “actions speak louder than words.”', '“Today,” he added, “we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.”', 'United’s report includes a description of what happened in the April 9 episode, though it contains few new details.', 'United released much of the same information on Wednesday in written answers to questions from the Senate Commerce Committee.', 'Dr. Dao and dozens of other passengers had boarded a United Express flight to Louisville in the late afternoon when the airline determined that maintenance issues with another plane might keep a four-person flight crew from reaching Louisville in time for a flight they were scheduled to work the next morning, according to the airline’s report.', 'The airline said it was worried that it might have to cancel the flight out of Louisville, disrupting 100 other passengers, if the crew was not there on time. So it offered an $800 travel credit to any passengers who agreed to give up their seats on the flight leaving Chicago.', 'When no one took the offer, gate agents invoked the airline’s involuntary denial-of-boarding process. According to the report, that meant customers who had paid the lowest fares, were not connecting to other flights and had checked in the latest were at the top of the list to be removed from the plane. Whether a customer had frequent-flier status was another consideration, the report says.', 'United officials have said they followed this procedure in selecting Dr. Dao, his wife and another couple from removal from the flight. The other couple agreed to accept compensation and leave. After Dr. Dao declined to leave, United officials called police officers with the Chicago Department of Aviation to try to persuade him to go.', 'But according to passenger videos and aviation police reports released on Tuesday, Dr. Dao tried to keep the officers from pulling him out of his seat before being dragged out of it.']"

Department Of Education Moves To Make Student Loan Process Easier While IRS Tool Is Down, This page covers some of the easier-to-read examples of how the government's financial aid system works.,"[' Betsy DeVos, U.S. secretary of education, listens during a strategic and policy discussion with U.S. President Donald Trump, not pictured, and executives at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 11, 2017. Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg', ""Applying for financial aid isn't going to be as bad as feared this year after all. The Department of Education Department has agreed to allow colleges and universities more flexibility to use as part of their verification procedures while the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) is unavailable."", 'The DRT was shut down in March of this year after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) noticed suspicious activity related to the tool. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a Senate Finance Committee in April that taxpayer data may have been compromised. While the exact numbers of affected taxpayers have not yet been determined, Koskinen told the Committee that it could be as many as 100,000.', 'As a result, while the IRS had initially planned to shut down the tool for a few weeks, the IRS and Federal Student Aid (FSA) subsequently released a joint announcement indicating that the DRT would be offline until the start of the next FAFSA season. That has created problems for students and their families who rely on the DRT for purposes of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information on the FAFSA is used to determine financial aid for the school year. For the most recent FAFSA cycle, there were 19,757,764 total applications: approximately one-quarter of those applications were students completing FAFSA for the first time.', ""The DRT isn't the only tool that can be used to complete the FAFSA. The information needed to complete the FAFSA can be found on a previously filed tax return. To complete a 201617 and 201718 FAFSA, students should manually enter 2015 tax information from the tax return filed in 2016 (not the 2016 tax information used to file in 2017). Students who do not have a copy of the appropriate tax return can order a tax transcript directly from IRS using the Get Transcript tool at www.irs.gov/transcript, or by calling 1.800.908.9946 to order a copy."", ""Filling out the FAFSA manually can slow down the financial aid process or result in errors. To help, Lynn B. Mahaffie, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, issued a letter (downloads as a pdf) directing schools to consider a signed paper copy of the 2015 IRS tax return that was used by the tax filer for submission to the IRS as acceptable documentation to verify FAFSA/ISIR tax return information. Additionally, colleges are no longer required to collect documentation obtained from the IRS or other tax authorities verifying that their family did not file a 2015 tax return (the so-called Verification of Nonfiling). Instead, the applicant or the applicant's family can provide the school with a signed statement certifying that the individual has not filed and is not required to file a 2015 income tax return, and a listing of the sources of any 2015 income earned by the individual from work and the amount of income from each source together with a form W2, or equivalent, for each source of that income."", 'Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said about the new measures, These flexibilities are an important step toward making the process easier. They help applicants who normally would have used the IRS DRT to more easily complete the application process. She added, We will continue to look for additional ways to ease the burdens created by the IRS DRT outage until the tool can be restored with added security measures in place later this year.', 'The new flexibilities begin immediately and apply to both the 2016-17 and 2017-18 FAFSA processing and verification cycles.']"

The particles would cause additional droplets to form, producing larger, denser and whiter clouds, which would reflect more heat back into space.', 'Australian scientists at The Sydney Institute of Marine Science believe cloud brightening could prove to be the most feasible \xa0and “environmentally benign” way to try to save the reef. The institute has awarded a fellowship to Dr Harrison to explore the scheme.

Are you buying the Yankees' hot start?," Aaron Judge has a chance to become the youngest player in history to hit 40 home runs in a major league season. ."" much","['Aaron Judge is blasting 460-foot moonshots. CC Sabathia is on pace for 18 wins. Despite losing two of three in Pittsburgh over the weekend, the New York Yankees head into a three-game set at Fenway Park against the rival Boston Red Sox as winners of 10 of their past 13 games, jumping to No. 5 in our MLB Power Rankings.', 'So is something special brewing in the Bronx, or is it just too soon to bet on the Bombers?', ""Our All-Star panel -- Yankees beat writer Andrew Marchand, columnist Sam Miller and SweetSpot's David Schoenfield -- weighs in."", ""Andrew Marchand: Judge's history at nearly every level of professional baseball has been to struggle at first, then hold his own. The majors don't seem to be any different. He struck out 42 of 84 at-bats in 2016, but now looks fearsome. If he is a .260, 35-homer and 100-RBI guy, I think the Yankees would sign up for that. Who doesn't think that's realistic? And he might be even better than that."", 'How far will the New York Yankees go in 2017? Vote at the bottom of the page »', ""Sam Miller: With the caveat that everything is prone to exaggeration in early season stats, yes, he is. Nobody hits the ball harder than Judge -- maybe not even Giancarlo Stanton -- and the pleasant surprise has been that he's not swinging and missing very often, with a contact rate close to the league average. And he's young and spry enough to avoid being a liability on defense or the basepaths."", ""David Schoenfield: He's obviously swinging the bat well, and there's a chance he's on a fast learning curve. After striking out 44 percent of the time in his major league call-up in 2016, he's cut that down to 25 percent. If he can maintain that rate, he will do a lot of damage. At the same time, his minor league numbers were also more good than great, so I'm not ready to call him the next Dave Winfield after 60-something at-bats."", ""Marchand: Well, they don't have Gary Sanchez or Didi Gregorius, so the question might be: Could they become even better? The thing is, Ronald Torreyes has been as good as Gregorius at short, while Austin Romine has held steady behind the plate. Chase Headley might have a very good year, but right now he might be the AL MVP. It would be hard to argue that that will continue."", 'Miller: For every case of ""no way can this keep up"" -- Headley\'s .339 batting average, Aaron Hicks\' .727 slugging percentage, Jacoby Ellsbury\'s best OPS+ since 2011 -- there\'s an equally plausible reason for optimism. Greg Bird has been making contact again and just needs a few balls to fall in, and Sanchez and Gregorius will return to the lineup. In the aggregate, it could be a considerably better lineup than last year\'s well-below-average group, but the April ""breakouts"" are mostly coming from established veterans who, realistically, probably aren\'t really breaking out.', ""Schoenfield: They were leading the AL in runs per game at the start of the week and they've been doing it without Sanchez and Gregorius. Of course, the guys playing in place of them have been terrific -- Romine has an .840 OPS and Torreyes has 13 RBIs. I love the addition of Matt Holliday, who will grind out at-bats and take his walks, and there is some depth on the bench. I'm not sure I'm buying all the power just yet: Judge, Hicks and Starlin Castro have combined for 14 home runs, a pace they won't keep up. So, is this a top-three offense? Probably not, but it should be better than last year when the Yankees were 12th in the AL in runs."", 'Marchand: It depends how you define ""back."" He is nothing like the hard-throwing Cy Young Award winner, who received a 10-figure contract. However, he is a legit starter, whose smarts have transformed his career to the point that his goal to play a lot longer seems very realistic. If he is a legit No. 2 starter, the idea of a Yankees wild card has more weight.', 'Miller: In fact, he\'s probably less ""back"" than he was last year, when he was sort of back. His strikeout and walk rates are just awful -- no starter in baseball last year had a higher walk rate and a lower K rate and managed to make it to even 75 innings -- and his overall strike rate this year is his lowest since 2004. It\'s only four starts, so it\'s too early to draw conclusions, but that\'s even more true when talking about something as volatile as ERA or win-loss record.', ""Schoenfield: I'd say the upside is something similar to last year, when he finished with a 3.91 ERA. The stuff isn't there to return to his old ace-level status, his walk rate is still higher than peak Sabathia and his strikeout rate through four starts is down even from last year. He's certainly learned to nibble at the corners, but he's a pitcher living right on the edge."", ""Marchand: I usually say that over 162 games, your beliefs usually bear out. Before the season, there was a rosy outlook, where Masahiro Tanaka is a Cy Young candidate, Sabathia continues his reinvention into an Andy Pettitte-clone, while Michael Pineda and Luis Severino reach their potential. Jordan Montgomery looks like he could be a real MLB starter. So, yes, they could have a very good year, though, I'm not totally sold."", ""Miller: Pineda and Severino have combined to strike out 56 batters and walk five. Then there's the nine home runs allowed and the hard contact, but there aren't many pitchers who have combined strikeout stuff with great control who have not succeeded."", ""Schoenfield: If there's a reason for optimism for the 2017 Yankees, it's the early performances of Pineda and Severino. Sure, Pineda has done this kind of stuff before, so you never know, but strike-throwing machine Severino looks like a different pitcher."", ""Marchand: I thought the Yankees would win around 84 games. I'll stay in that range, though they have come out very strong against a weak schedule. The Rays, White Sox and Cardinals might all be last-place teams, or close to it, this year. The Yankees can only beat who is in front of them. So far -- especially at home -- they have done a fine job of it. So I think there is evidence that they will finish above .500 again, but I don't think they are a World Series contender -- yet."", ""Miller: They were a .500 team coming into the season and they've banked a couple extra wins early. That's enough to join the wild-card race."", 'Schoenfield: Hey, I picked them as a wild-card team before the season, so no reason to change my mind now -- especially with the Blue Jays stinking things up and other potential wild cards like the Mariners and Royals not looking so great either.']"
The 6 Biggest Credit Mistakes Millennials Are Making," Money expert Jane Hwangbo shares six etiquette-less, smart credit mistakes millennials should be aware of in the future.","[""Of all the financial mistakes that can come back to haunt you, the ones that impact your credit score can seem minor at the time but have lasting effects. Your credit score is only going to get more important as your financial life progresses. It comes into play when you're renting an apartment, being considered for a loan or trying to buy a house. Your credit score is meant to be a reflection of how you handle your money, and problems that arise sometimes come from not understanding how to effectively manage your money or your credit cards.  Seeing as most people aren't given a financial crash course before signing on for their first credit card or student loan, it's not surprising that young professionals can get off to a rocky start credit-wise. To help you protect your finances now and in the future, here are six credit mistakes millennials need to be wary of:"", '1. Opening store credit cards just to cash in on the rewards.', 'Financial expert Jane Hwangbo, a former portfolio manager and the founder of MissionOverMoney.com, says that while a store card may get you an initial discount and enticing future rewards, opening them tends to be damaging in the long term. She says, They usually carry nosebleed high interest rates (often higher than 20%), so that if you carry a balance instead of paying it off in full every month and make only minimum payments, you end up owing way more than the amount you paid for your purchase. Paying attention to the interest rate on your credit card is crucial. In a survey conducted by Experian, only half of the millennials asked knew what the interest rate on their card was.', '2. Not keeping track of how often your credit report is pulled.', ""The amount you (or someone else) checks your credit score impacts the score itself, and often times people are not even aware of when their score is being checked. Often if you're applying for a new credit card or housing, the issuer or landlord will pull a hard credit inquiry. Hwangbo says, One inquiry doesn't make much of a dent on your overall score, but multiple credit checks can push you into a higher-risk category for lenders, causing an increase in the interest rates you're offered when you apply for some major purchases, such as a home."", '3. Treating credit cards like cash.', ""Hwangbo: Credit cards are not cash. We can spend money on them like cash, but whatever we use is instantly new debt on our personal balance sheet. Remembering that, especially if you already have student loans outstanding, may help. Let's be honest, who needs to owe more money these days? You're putting off your financial freedom."", ""4. Using credit cards to pay for extravagances you can't afford."", ""There is definitely a divide in our perception of how credit cards should be used. The general approach to credit cards is that you should, at the very least, use them for big purchases, but some take that to mean they should use credit cards for purchases they can't actually afford. What it actually means is that while big purchases, like plane tickets or a new couch, should be put on your credit card, they should only be purchased if you have the funds to pay off the balance when it's due. Buying things you can't pay off in the very near future is an easy way to accumulate credit card debt."", 'More on Forbes: ', '5. Not opening a credit card or opening too many.', ""While millennials are known to be hesitant when it comes to credit cards (Bankrate reports that 63% of millennials don't have a credit card), a common problem amongst credit card users is that they end up with too many. Often if you're carrying credit card debt, it may be spread over more than one card. You need to be careful with how many cards you open, because closing credit cards can impact your score adversely. However, not building credit isn't good either, which is the problem with avoiding credit cards altogether. Hwangbo says, In general, the length of credit history accounts for about 15% of your overall score. And remember, you don't have to close accounts that are not in use, even with $0 balance. If you need to consolidate the number of credit card accounts you have open, I suggest fully paying off the card with the poorest payment history that you've had open for the shortest period of time. The negative history will fall off your credit report after seven years."", '6. Not understanding the nuances of when to make payments or what your credit card limit is.', ""A third of the millennials surveyed by Experian did not know the spending limit on their credit cards. Hwangbo recommends keeping your credit card balances below 30% of your available credit on any given card. This is fairly common advice, and it's impossible to follow if you don't even know what your spending limit is. Beyond that, millennials may struggle with not understanding when their payment is due, and what they should actually be paying (the statement balance, versus the entire card balance). The best course of action is to pay the credit card bill (often phrased as statement balance) in full by the end of the billing cycle.""]"

"8 Habits That Make Millennials Stressed, Anxious And Unproductive"," On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal ran an article citing figures that suggest millennials are the most stressed generation ever.- Condé Nast..'""","['According to the American Psychological Association (APA), millennials experience more stress and are less able to manage it than any other generation. More than half of us admit to having lain awake at night during the past month from stress.', 'Not surprisingly, millennials are also more anxious than older Americans. The APA reports that 12% of millennials have a diagnosed anxiety disorder almost twice the percentage of Boomers. On a non-clinical scale, a BDA Morneau Shepell white paper discovered that 30% of working millennials have general anxiety, while a 2014 American College Health Association (ACHA) assessment found that anxiety regularly afflicts 61% of college students.', ""Anxiety not only harms our wellbeing but also sabotages our productivity. The ACHA assessment found that the top two tolls on students' academic performance were stress and anxiety. Two-thirds of millennials interviewed by BDA attribute declining work performance to anxiety."", ""Sources of millennial anxiety may include a tough job market and student debt as well as psychological causes I've covered previously such as ambition addiction, career crises and choice-overload. But even our day-to-day behaviors can incite anxiety. Here are eight common habits that instigate stress and compromise our potential:"", ' Flickr/Stefan', '1. Bad sleep habits', 'Perhaps the most prevalent contributor to anxiety is poor sleep. A study by the University of California at Berkeley found that lack of sleep may play a key role in ramping up the brain regions that contribute to excessive worrying. Common causes of insufficient sleep include going to bed at different times, not making sleep a priority and spending time on phones or laptops right before bed.', 'Instead:', 'Calm Clinic, an online magazine dedicated to anxiety management, suggests forming a long, boring nighttime routine free from technology, keeping a journal by your bed to write down thoughts that keep you awake, and exercising during the day to wear out your body.', 'The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market', ""Don't let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good."", '2. Skipping sustenance', 'Eating consistently regulates not only our metabolism and insulin levels but also our mental stability.', 'Waiting too long to eat or missing out on breakfast may lead to unsteady blood sugar levels, which can cause anxiety-like sensations, including shakiness, dizziness, confusion, and difficulty speaking, writes Body and Health. Dehydration has a similar effect. Because food and water are biological needs, anxiety naturally follows hunger and thirst.', 'Instead:', 'Eat meals regularly. Keep granola bars or nuts at your desk or in your purse. Bring a water bottle to work and sip it throughout the day. Have a glass of water right when you wake up and before you go to sleep.', ' Unsplash', '3. Drinking coffee', ""Drinking coffee makes us more alert and, in many cases, helps us perform better on short-term tasks. But it can also make people jittery, irritable and nervous, especially if they're already predisposed to anxiety. Sensitivity to caffeine is, in fact, heightened in people with panic disorder and social phobia, and caffeine can provoke panic attacks in some individuals. Caffeine is also diuretic, which can cause dehydration an anxiety trigger established above."", 'Instead:', 'Try weaning off coffee by switching to just one cup a day, decaf or black tea. If you feel calmer and more in control after a couple weeks without it, commit to quitting and pull out all the stops.', '4. Sitting', ""America's surge of anxiety symptoms parallels our increasingly sedentary lifestyles. But, until a recent review by BMC Public Health, it was unclear whether the two were actually linked. After lengthy analysis, researchers found that the risk of anxiety risk increases as sedentary behavior increases and, specifically, sitting time spikes one's likelihood of experiencing anxiety."", 'Instead:', ""If you work at a desk all day, you're not doomed. Get up and walk around every ninety minutes. Offset your sitting time with regular exercise, which halves your risk of anxiety and depression."", '5. Your phone ', 'A 2014 study by Baylor University found that American students spend an average of nine hours a day on their phone. Of course, technology vastly improves our lives in innumerable ways. But too much of it makes us anxious. Screen-based entertainment increases central nervous system arousal, which can amplify anxiety. Social media is similarly associated with low moods and depression.', 'Instead:', ""Next time you're waiting or have nothing to do, leave your phone in your pocket or purse. Relinquish it as a means of alleviating boredom and instead use it consciously as needed for its useful functions."", ' Flickr/Lily Monster', '6. Not clocking out', ""According to data from FORBES' @Work State of Mind Project, millennials become anxious and irritated when work intrudes on our personal lives. But our bad work-life balance is our own choosing. BDA's assessment explains, Millennials do not believe that productivity should be measured by the number of hours worked at the office, but by the output of the work performed. They view work as a 'thing' and not a 'place.' Even after we leave the office, we're still at work."", 'Instead:', ""We can still be ambitious, work long hours and impress our bosses without sacrificing psychological health and personal boundaries. So clock out: In your calendar, schedule a defined, consistent time at night to stop working. When time's up, mark that task complete and go take care of yourself."", '7. Netflix and hanging out', 'You may think snuggling up on the couch and watching a movie will help you unwind, but research disproves this trend.', ""In one study, participants felt more depressed and anxious after watching just two hours of TV than those who didn't. Another study found that those with anxiety and depression spend significantly more time on the computer and watching television. While resting reduces anxiety short-term, research reveals that its effect is short lived, particularly compared with exercise."", 'Instead:', ""Do anything but watch TV when you're done with work. Go on a walk, grab drinks, knit, work, draw, write, sit in your room and look at the wall, call your mom, actually cook dinner, build something, play badminton."", '8. Hanging out with anxious people', ""You might feel like you've found someone you can vent to who understands you, but studies show that ruminating on anxiety often makes it worse. Furthermore, participating in intergroup anxiety increases one's anxious behaviors."", 'Instead:', ""Seek out people who level your mood. After you hang out with someone, ask yourself if you feel stable and well or if you're hyped up and on edge. It's easy to spend less time with certain people once you've decided they're bad for your health."", ' ', ""If the annoyance, pain and performance impairment of day-to-day anxiety isn't enough to quit these bad habits, perhaps this is: According to Harvard Medical School, anxiety is implicated in heart disease, migraines, chronic respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal conditions."", 'Despite our youth, chronic anxiety is not sustainable.

"Too Much Sugar Linked To Reduced Memory, Brain Volume"," Two new studies have shown that getting too much sugar from sugary drinks is linked to memory loss, writes the Associated Press. a","[""The sugar-brain connection isn't just a theory anymore. There's some fairly convincing and reproducible evidence that too much sugar in the diet is linked to cognitive and brain deficits. Two new papers, both deriving data from the long-running Framingham Heart Study, bear this out. One study finds that sugary drinks are linked to pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease: Poor memory and reduced brain volume in certain areas. The other study finds that artificial sweeteners aren't much better they're linked to a greater risk of stroke and of dementia. So it seems like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't, at least when it comes to sweetened drinks."", ' Shutterstock', ""The first of the studies, from Boston University School of Medicine, followed more than 4,200 people, periodically testing them for memory and cognition, and scanning their brains with MRI to measure volume. The participants also filled out questionnaires about their food intake, including sugary drink consumption (including both soda and fruit juices). Sugary drinks are a great way to study excess sugar, since they have almost no redeeming nutritional qualities, like protein or fiber to slow their absorption it's like a straight drug to the system."", ""It turned out that people who consumed more sweetened drinks had poorer memory and reduced overall brain volume (particularly in the hippocampus, the area that's known to house short-term memory), compared to people who didn't drink sugary drinks."", 'In fact, the authors calculated that one to two sugary drinks per day was associated with 1.6 years of brain aging; more than two drinks per day was associated with two extra years of aging. For memory, the association was even more pronounced: One to two, and greater than two, sugary drinks per day corresponded to 5.8 and 11 years of brain aging, respectively.', ""The other study, also using data from the Framingham participants, looked at the link between sugary drink consumption, artificially sweetened drink consumption and dementia and stroke. It didn't find a link between sugary drinks and dementia or stroke, but it did find a link between artificially sweetened drink consumption and both types of brain disease. In fact, participants who drank at least one artificially sweetened drink per day were three times as likely to develop stroke and almost three times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why didn't the second study find a link between sugar and brain disease, as the first one did? There are a number of possible reasons, says study author Matthew Pase. One is that in our sample, people didn't frequently consume regular soda more drank diet drinks. So it's possible we were underpowered since sugary drinks just weren't that widely consumed. The other point he makes is that the people who often consumed sugary beverages were at risk of other diseases so they may not have had time to develop the brain diseases that were being tested for."", ""Despite the lack of sugar-brain disease connection in the second study, Pase says he strongly believes in the connection between sugar and brain disease, given the results of his first one, and the fast-growing body of other work that's illuminating the connection. We know that sugar beverages and excess sugar are associated with metabolic disease, he says. The brain relies on a steady flow of blood. Metabolic and vascular diseases don't just happen in the body they happen in the brain, too. Earlier work has shown in both mice and humans that impaired glucose function is linked not only to cognitive deficits but also to the patterns of protein dysfunction (amyloid-beta and tau) that are associated with Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why artificial sweetener consumption would be linked to brain disease is another question. Reverse causation could be a factor, whereby people with already-existing health problems are more likely to drink artificially sweetened drinks in an effort to be healthier for instance people who already have diabetes are more likely to switch to diet drinks as a result, and they're also more likely to develop dementia. Or it could be that diet drinks screw up the brain's feedback system, so people unwittingly seek out sugar elsewhere. Artificial sweetener has also been shown to tweak one's gut bacteria, the disruption of which can be linked to glucose intolerance and metabolic disease."", ""The bottom line is that sugar is just as bad for the brain as it is for other organs, maybe worse. Considering that the brain is charged with a lot of critical processes, especially the ones that make us who we are memory, empathy, emotion it's not a good idea to mess with it by consuming the wrong things. After researchers figured out that sugar isn't healthy, we switched to artificial sweetener now we know that it's not without its own risks. Until science figures out a safe way to sweeten liquids, it might be that water, coffee and tea are the only smart options.""]"

Hinton’s ""The Outsiders,"" a teen classic, turns 50"," We spoke to one of the cast members of it all, Rob Lowe, who reveals what it was like to play Jake Epping in the hit Hollywood teen movie, The Outsiders, as it hits the big screen this week.","['We’ll be getting a look INSIDE “THE OUTSIDERS” this morning. Serena Altschul has a close-up on the classic novel and teen movie:', 'For fans of the 1983 coming-of-age film, “The Outsiders,” maybe the only thing better than watching the movie … is watching it with Rob Lowe.', '“Look how handsome Matt is! Looks like a movie star,” said Lowe.', '“Frankly, you are all ridiculously handsome,” said Altschul.', 'It was a cast of hearthrobs and Hollywood stars-in-the-making. Along with Lowe, there’s Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio and Tom Cruise, wearing prosthetic teeth.', '“He hasn’t taken his fake tooth out yet; he does that after the rumble,” Lowe said.', 'Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, “The Outsiders” didn’t just help launch careers. For then-18-year-old Lowe, it saved his. “’The Outsiders’ was my last audition that I was going to go before I sort of gave it up,” he said. “If I hadn’t been cast in ‘The Outsiders,’ I wouldn’t be an actor, ‘cause that was the last train leaving the station for me.”', 'Lowe holds the film close to his heart …. and a big reason is Susan Eloise Hinton, the woman who came up with the story more than half a century ago.', '“Suzie was able to capture a moment in everybody’s life that everybody will have, and that is that adolescent striving for the next chapter, which is what ‘The Outsiders’ is about,” he said. “There’s always going to be an audience for that, and there always has been an audience for that.”', 'She’s known to her legions of readers as S.E. Hinton, the initials a suggestion from her editors.', 'As she recalled, “They said, ‘We’re wondering if you use your initials, S.E., on this because we’re afraid the first reviewers will pick up the book, see what the content matter is, and review it with a bias.’ Like a girl wouldn’t know anything about this.”', 'In fact, she knew plenty.', '“The Outsiders” was published in 1967. Fifty years later, it’s considered a classic, and a pioneer in the young adult fiction category. It has sold more than 10 million copies, been translated into dozens of languages, and is part of the core curriculum in schools across the country.', 'And to think Hinton started writing it when she was only 15. “Well, it was about 40 pages long, single-space typed. And then I did most of the work on it my junior year in high school, where I made a D in creative writing.”', 'Now 68, Hinton took Altschul back to that very school in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the city she was raised in, and still calls home.', '“Everybody had their own little space to hang out in. And the Socials hung out down here at this entrance. That was their spot.”', '“The Outsiders” is about adolescent angst and the battles between two groups: The affluent “Socs” (short for Socials) and the lower-class “Greasers” centered around the Curtis brothers: Ponyboy, Darrel and Sodapop (played by Lowe in the film).', '“You have to understand, for me, look, I’m 53 years old and I can walk out of this building, down the street and there will be a 12-year-old girl who will go, ‘Sodapop!’” he said.\xa0', '“They know who you are,” said Altschul.\xa0', '“’You’re twelve!’”', '“What is it about Sodapop, and Ponyboy, that resonates with so many people?”', '“The world’s biggest fans, first of all, are girls for ‘The Outsiders.’ And I think at the age they’re reading it -- they’re seventh and eighth grade girls -- and they’re reading ‘The Outsiders’ and they’re going, ‘Oh, so this is what boys are really like.’”', 'Hinton said she gets many letters saying “Your book changed my life.”', '“That scares me, frankly,” she said. “Because who am I to change anybody’s life? The only way I can deal with the impact ‘The Outsiders’ has had worldwide is to think that it was meant to be written, I was chosen to write it, and it’s out there.”', 'The movie was shot almost entirely in Tulsa. The building used as the home of the Curtis brothers is being turned into a museum.', 'Hinton was a special advisor to Francis Ford Coppola during the filming. And to the young actors, she was something more: “She embraced us,” Lowe said. “She made us feel safe, she helped us navigate the very complicated Francis world. And she loved us.”', 'To which Hinton said, “I loved it. I loved every minute.”', '“God, she used to get on me for my southern California speak,” Lowe said. “She once bet me $60 that I couldn’t get through lunch without saying her word gnarly. ’Oh my God it’s so gnarly!’ ‘Francis had us shooting this scene, it was so gnarly!’', '“I don’t think I made it through lunch. I think I still owe her the 60!”', 'What is so enduring about ‘The Outsiders?’ Why does it connect with young people? For Hinton, it’s simple: “When you reread the book, at least I do, you just think it’s so over the top emotionally. I would never have the nerve to write that un-self-consciously again. But at that time, that was exactly the way I felt. And I think that’s one reason why kids identify so strongly. They’re gonna like that.”', 'Hinton has fans the world over … and one of her biggest has this message for her: “I would say thanks for being a mom when we all needed one,” Lowe said.', 'To watch a trailer for “The Outsiders” click on the video player below.\xa0', 'For more info:', 'Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the new 24/7 digital news network.

9 incredible ways we're using drones for social good," Drones, the small, autonomous machines known as aerial vehicles (popularizing the term "" drones"" in the UK), have seen considerable adoption when it comes to various social missions aimed at improving the world around us.","[""When it comes to alleviating some of the world's most pressing problems, perhaps we should look to the skies."", 'The word ""drone"" might inspire images of counterterrorism strikes and the future of package delivery.

Drones helped aid organizations identify areas of need in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, locate mines displaced by the massive Balkan floods in 2014, and document the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in 2015.', 'Now, companies are testing to see how drones can regularly deliver humanitarian aid, rather than just inform NGOs where to go.', ""San Francisco-based Otherlab recently launched the world's most advanced industrial paper airplanes to do just that. The APSARA glider is made of biodegradable materials, and can carry more than two pounds of lifesaving supplies, such as blood and vaccines. When dropped out of a cargo airplane, the drones' interior tech helps them steer themselves in a spiral motion to a designated location using GPS and autopilot. It can land within a 33-foot radius of its intended destination."", ""Another project wants survivors of natural disasters to get their aid and eat it, too. Windhorse Aerospace created an inexpensive prototype called Pouncer, whose wings are packed with food. The protective covers surrounding the food can double as shelter, while the the drone's plywood frame can be used as firewood."", ""It can be extremely difficult (and even dangerous) for aid workers to get to people in hard-to-reach areas, whether it's a rural region of a developing nation, or a country plagued by conflict. But if you cut humans out of the equation, the seemingly insurmountable task gets a little easier."", 'Drones are helping animal scientists and researchers make strides in their fields, simply by giving them views they never had before.', 'For example, earlier this month researchers at Oregon State University\'s Marine Mammal Institute captured rare aerial footage of blue whales ""lunge-feeding"" on krill.

How The Shale Boom Turned The World Upside Down," Trump, on tap for his maiden speech on energy policy at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on November 18, 2005, made this statement to the Hill about Nigeria, which is currently under an oil embargo:'","[' Pump jacks are seen on the Bakken Shale Formation, near Williston, North Dakota, on September 6, 2016. Photo credit ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images.', 'Overemphasizing the shift in the energy markets since 2005 is hard. Had you predicted the shift that was to come, you would have been widely deemed a lunatic. But let me take you back there for a moment and remind you of where we stood, and what played out over the next decade.', ""U.S. oil production had seemingly peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day (BPD), and by 2005 had declined for 35 years. Production in 2005 stood at 5.2 million BPD, and crude oil imports had reached 10.1 million BPD -- just under 50% of total U.S. petroleum consumption. The U.S. economy was in a precarious situation, highly dependent on oil imports from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia; countries whose interests weren't always aligned with our own."", ""Concerns about oil supplies weren't limited to the U.S. In 2005 energy investment banker Matt Simmons published Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy. Simmons helped set off a fierce debate about whether Saudi Arabia -- and the world as a whole -- had reached a global peak in oil production. This thesis gained traction over the next three years, as oil prices surged past $100/bbl and helped push the world into recession. The U.S. desperately needed a miracle to reverse decades of growing energy dependence. Actually one was in the works, unbeknownst to most Americans."", 'The situation in natural gas was much the same. U.S. gas production had peaked in 1973 at 21.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). By 1986 production had fallen to 16 Tcf, but in 2005 had recovered a bit to 18.1 Tcf. Not only did he sound the alarm on oil, but Matt Simmons had also predicted in 2003 that with certainty, by 2005 the US would embark on a long-term natural gas crisis for which the only solution was to pray.', ""Simmons wasn't the only one to think that a natural gas crisis was imminent. In fact, it was widely believed that this would be the case, and companies began to plan and build liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to cope with the expected shortfall. Natural gas prices began to spike ever higher during 2005, and the Henry Hub Gulf Coast Natural Gas Spot Price crossed $15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) by year-end."", 'Insiders like Matt Simmons and T. Boone Pickens initially appeared to be correct in forecasting an energy crisis for the U.S. But these insiders were seemingly unaware that oil and gas producers were refining a technique that would turn the world energy markets upside down.', 'Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking had been around since the late 1940s and had been used extensively to promote higher production rates from conventional oil and gas wells. Fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and a proppant (like sand) down an oil or gas well under high pressure to break open channels (fractures) in the reservoir rock trapping the deposit. Oil and gas do not travel easily through certain reservoir types, which is why they need to be fractured. The proppant is designed to hold those channels open, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow to the well bore.', 'But legendary oilman George Mitchell was one of the key players behind the innovation that made such a dramatic change in the trajectory of the U.S. oil and gas markets. Mitchell combined fracking with horizontal drilling -- another standard technique used in the oil and gas industry. Like fracking, horizontal drilling had been around a while and had been widely applied in the oil and gas industry since the 1980s.', 'Horizontal drilling involves drilling down to an oil or gas deposit and then turning the drill horizontal to the formation to access a greater fraction of the deposit. These horizontal laterals can be 5,000 to 10,000 feet in length, and hydraulically fracturing them enabled economic oil and gas production for the first time from shale formations scattered across the U.S.', ""Success in natural gas came first. From 2005, U.S. natural gas production rose for 10 straight years. The previous production record set in 1973 was obliterated as production grew 50% from 2005 to 2015 to reach 27 Tcf. In the process, the U.S. became the world's largest natural gas producer."", 'U.S. oil production started to rise in 2008, and the next seven years marked the fastest oil production increase in U.S. history. Instead of continued declines, production of U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids increased by an astounding six million BPD. Net imports of crude oil and products to the U.S. fell from 12.5 million BPD in 2005 to 4.7 million BPD in 2015. The U.S. began exporting finished products and even crude oil into the market', 'The dramatic shift in the U.S. oil and gas industry sent shockwaves not only across the country but around the world. Ultimately OPEC responded to the threat with a price war to win back market share that was being lost. To date, it looks like that strategy has failed, but this is a game with many innings still to be played.']"

Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U.S. companies to keep jobs in this country. Those who say the economy is getting better outnumber those who say it’s getting worse by the biggest margin in 15 years in Post-ABC polling.', 'But the president’s balance sheet overall tilts toward the negative.

Meanwhile, he shows little improvement on his temperament and honesty, and while he’s gained ground on empathy, over 6 in 10 still say he does not understand the problems of people like them.', '[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]', 'With a week remaining before his 100th day in office, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative accomplishment, having been dealt a major setback when Republicans in Congress decided not to proceed with a vote on a health-care bill supported by the White House. His clearest achievement is the successful nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.', 'Executive actions on trade, immigration, climate and government organization have pointed the direction he wants to take the country, though his controversial proposed travel ban that affects a number of Muslim-majority nations remains blocked by the courts. Trump and others in his administration have attacked the courts, accusing them of overreach, but nearly 6 in 10 people see their actions as a legitimate role for the judicial branch.', 'Overseas, he has demonstrated his willingness to use military force, with targeted strikes in Syria and the use of one of the biggest non-nuclear devices in the U.S. arsenal in Afghanistan. But tensions with North Korea remain high and the administration’s policy in the Middle East remains cloudy.', 'The 100-day marker is in part an artificial measuring post for any president, but by comparison, Trump has reached this point in his presidency faring worse to much worse than other recent presidents. An electorate that was deeply divided throughout the 2016 campaign remains so today, with opposition seemingly hardened and unyielding on most questions regarding his presidency.', 'The president’s approval rating stands at 42 percent, the lowest recorded at this stage of a presidency dating to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump’s 53 percent disapproval rating is 14 percentage points higher than Bill Clinton’s 39 percent disapproval in April 1993, the worst before Trump.

Among Trump voters who say they were “somewhat enthusiastic” or less excited about supporting him, 88 percent approve of his current performance and 79 percent say he understands the problems of people like them.', 'Bill Clinton also had a rocky start to his presidency, which colored public judgments of his presidency by the 100-day mark. Although just 42 percent say Trump has accomplished either a great deal or a good amount so far, that is slightly higher than the 37 percent who said the same about Clinton in 1993.', 'Similarly, judgments on whether campaign promises have been kept put Trump on about equal footing with Bill Clinton — 44 percent and 42 percent respectively.

The most notable exception is his effort to pressure U.S. companies on the issues of keeping jobs at home, where 73 percent of Americans approve, including 54 percent of Democrats.', 'Another issue where the public sides with Trump rather than his critics is whether it is a conflict of interest for Trump to spend time at his own properties.

Mr. Bush resisted pressure from his aides and supporters to criticize his successor during the months after Mr. Obama took office.', '“People around him wanted him to do it,” recalled James Glassman, the founding director of the George W. Bush Institute. “People would come to me and say, ‘Can’t you get the president to defend No Child Left Behind?’ His legacy was about to be wiped off the face of the earth. The answer was no. That’s not the way he saw his post-presidency.”', 'Mr. Glassman said that Mr. Bush’s keep-quiet approach toward Mr. Obama was shaped by what he saw as unfair criticism by former President Jimmy Carter of his father, the elder President George Bush.', '“I would try to get him to do things like talk about immigration policy and say the things he said as president,” Mr. Glassman said of Mr. Bush. “He would absolutely not do it.”', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', 'But rarely has an outgoing president faced a successor like Mr. Trump.', 'In the weeks after winning the White House, Mr. Trump assembled a cabinet intended to eradicate most of Mr. Obama’s accomplishments. Once in office, Mr. Trump accused the former president of wiretapping him, without offering any evidence, and he said on Twitter that Mr. Obama was a “Bad (or sick) guy!” Mr. Trump also accused his predecessor of being behind national security leaks, and he all but blamed Mr. Obama for Syria’s chemical weapons attacks.', 'The pressure on Mr. Obama to enter the fray has steadily increased as Mr. Trump moved to reverse Obama-era environmental protections, ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, abandon trade deals, eliminate progressive regulations and install a conservative Supreme Court justice.', 'Through it all, Mr. Obama has stayed mostly silent. (During a conference call with thousands of despairing supporters a week after the election, Mr. Obama said only: “Don’t mope. And don’t get complacent.”)', 'After the Obama family moved into a nine-bedroom mansion a few miles from the White House in January, they began a series of vacations, each captured in grainy snapshots posted online.', 'Mr. Obama quickly left Washington for Palm Springs, Calif., and then it was off to a private island in the British Virgin Islands with the British billionaire Richard Branson, where he was photographed kitesurfing.', 'More recently, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, spent nearly a month in French Polynesia. A snapshot of the former president taking a picture of Michelle on the deck of Mr. Geffen’s yacht, the Rising Sun, went viral on the internet.', 'On Monday, the former president will return to his adopted hometown, Chicago, for a conversation with a half-dozen young people in front of an audience of college students.', 'As he begins his paid speeches, Mr. Obama, who is represented by the Harry Walker Agency, is scheduled to engage in a private conversation with the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for the employees of the A&E television network.', 'On May 7 in Boston, Mr. Obama will accept the Profile in Courage Award given annually by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. He will deliver a speech at the library’s black-tie dinner. His remarks — built around the theme of what courage means in today’s world — will not name Mr. Trump.', 'Later in May, Mr. Obama will be with his White House chef and friend, Sam Kass, in Italy for a session at the Global Food Innovation Summit about the effect of climate change on food sources. On May 25, Mr. Obama is to participate in a public discussion at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, joined by Ms. Merkel, a close ally during his time in office.', 'In both European countries, Mr. Obama will also deliver paid speeches.', 'Some longtime supporters still hope to see Mr. Obama eventually return to the impassioned oratory they remember from the 2008 and 2012 campaign trail.', '“Everyone is anxious,” said John Morgan, a lawyer and one of Mr. Obama’s longtime donors.', 'But Mr. Morgan said it made more sense for Mr. Obama to keep a low profile until next year, when Democratic candidates for the House and Senate will need help winning re-election.', '“You have got to pick your battles. Timing is everything,” Mr. Morgan said. “If you come out 100 days after the election throwing haymakers, I think your credibility wanes. He’s better to save himself for the fall of 2018 and speak from a higher perch.”', 'Louis Frillman, a board member of Organizing for Action, the group that grew out of Mr. Obama’s campaign, said Democrats needed to learn not to rely only on the former president. But he said it would be up to Mr. Obama to decide how much to engage.', '“I’m not going to give him public advice,” Mr. Frillman said. “He’ll know how to deal with things in due course.”']"
Hackers Tricking Japan's Mobile Gamers With Offers of Fake Fantasy Cash," Cybercriminals in Japan are targeting gamers by mimicking the lures of popular games, aiming to steal private data and business secrets.","['Gamers beware: hackers offering free virtual trinkets don’t care about your passwords or personal data, but your employer’s most closely guarded secrets.', 'An employee at a Japanese high-tech company learned this the hard way, duped by a fake giveaway for 300 magic stones for the smartphone game\xa0Puzzle & Dragons. “Congratulations,” began the email promoting free in-game currency for the first 100 lucky takers: “Click here!” That initiated a drive-by download that surreptitiously installed\xa0remote access software.', 'Cyber criminals are stepping up these kind of schemes to break into\xa0corporate networks in Japan, according to FireEye Inc., a security software provider. While exact figures aren’t available,\xa0hundreds of businesses are compromised each month and the numbers are rising, the Milpitas, California-based company said. Although such spear phishing\xa0attacks aren’t new, hackers are discovering that mimicking game-industry promotions can be very effective. Case in point: Puzzle & Dragons has been downloaded more than 45 million times.', '“What makes Japan unique is that the gaming community spans demographics and age groups,” said Wias Issa, senior director at FireEye, who was in charge of operations in the country until April. “You’re not going to get the same ‘kill rate’ in other countries.”', 'To understand why targeting gamers is such a enticing vector of attack, look no further than the closing ceremony of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe donned a Super Mario outfit to promote Japan’s hosting of the 2020 games. The national agency in charge of cyber security chose as its mascot a character from Sword Art Online, a popular anime set in a virtual-reality game.', 'GungHo Online Entertainment Inc., the maker of Puzzle & Dragons, Colopl Inc. and other Japanese game makers have also become very good at making money from free-to-play smartphone titles. Japanese spend on average $30 a month on smartphone games, more than double their counterparts in the U.S. and triple the U.K., according to market researcher App Annie. The most profitable title of 2016 worldwide wasn’t Pokemon Go or Clash of Clans, but Monster Strike, a popular Japanese game.', '“These attackers will follow an economic trail, because they know the gaming companies have identified specific patterns of user behavior,” Issa said. “They’ll take their time doing homework about what games are popular and what types of promotions are going on right now.”', 'Japanese publishers combine psychology, art and big data to get players to return as often as possible and eventually pay for digital extras like weapons or skills. GungHo constantly plies its users with promotions, offering new levels and playable monster characters. It also conditions players to respond to time pressure, with some events lasting just a few hours.', '“The game’s large user base may be the reason why it attracts scams” and GungHo has an internal team to deal with particularly egregious cases, said Haruka Sudo, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based company. GungHo never gives away its virtual trinkets for free, she said.', 'While the magic-stone breach came from an unclassified threat group, many can be traced to state-based actors in China and North Korea, according to FireEye. They target specific enterprises in energy, chemical engineering and construction, the security firm said.\xa0', 'Japan enacted the Basic Act on Cybersecurity in November 2014 and established the National Center for Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity the following year, but still doesn’t have laws requiring companies to disclose breaches unless they involve loss of personal data.', '“Japan is just beginning to put this important infrastructure in place, so it’s not yet ready for cyber attacks,” said Daisuke Tatsuno, a partner covering intellectual property and information technology matters at Baker & McKenzie’s Tokyo office. “Private companies have a general awareness that such attacks are possible, but few are taking concrete steps to prepare.”']"
