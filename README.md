## Files used for running models
`ClickbaitClassifier.ipynb` - notebook for training clickbait classifier. <br/>
`Fudge_running.ipynb` - [Fudge](https://github.com/yangkevin2/naacl-2021-fudge-controlled-generation) based implementation for generating controllable clickbait titles. It contains setup for generating titles, rating them according to our clickbait classifier and saving in respective dataframes. Our Huggingface Spaces implementation uses this model due to realtime response. At the end of this notebook there is also a Gradio section where you can launch in-notebook Gradio application. <br/>
`PPLM_running.ipynb` - [PPLM](https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM/) based implementation for generating controllable clickbait titles. It contains setup for generating titles, rating them according to our clickbait classifier and saving in respective dataframes. <br/>
`DataSet_sentence_collector.ipynb` - sentence collector on Fudge and PPLM dataframes generated by `Fudge_running.ipynb` and `PPLM_running.ipynb`. It was used for sampling best titles that were generated. <br/>
`DatasetAnalysis.ipynb` - notebook for running wordcloud and LDA topic modelling analysis on ground truth titles. <br/>

## Folders used for running analysis and models

`DataProcessing` - used for generating all relevant tables in a report and presentation. Contains `fudge_csv`, `PPLM_csv` and `pegasus_clickbait_summarizer_csv` folders for .csv files that were used for the report and visualizations of respective models.<br/>
`fudge` - [Fudge](https://github.com/yangkevin2/naacl-2021-fudge-controlled-generation) adapted to our clickbait summarizer. <br/>
`PPLM` - [PPLM](https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM/) adapted to our clickbait summarizer. <br/>
