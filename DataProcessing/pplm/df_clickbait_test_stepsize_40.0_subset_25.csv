People who\xa0work reduced schedules might earn\xa0a reduced salary.\xa0 \xa0Under the program, employees such as Sanchez don't have to stress about asking\xa0for a flexible arrangement—or the guilt or stigma that might bring.

Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an interview this week. “We’d love to solve things diplomatically, but it’s very difficult.”', 'Hours after the U.N. meeting, North Korea fired another missile early Saturday local time, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Cmdr.

" Goldman Sachs' first-quarter results were better than expected, but the results were overshadowed by one trader's loss on a bet on Peabody Energy.",,"['Adam Savarese was looking to make a splash in his new job as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s top distressed-debt trader last year, and found it in Peabody Energy Corp.', 'The coal miner was hurtling toward bankruptcy. Savarese snagged its unsecured bonds for pennies on the dollar and rode them up for one of 2016’s most successful trades, according to people familiar with the desk and its wagers. It was risky: Some peers at other banks played it safer with secured bonds, which offered greater protection, though a smaller upside.\xa0But Savarese’s blockbuster Peabody move helped engineer a rebound on a desk\xa0buffeted by losses and the departure of senior leaders.', 'Now that same rescue play is inflicting pain. Though the trade is still a winner over its lifetime, it reversed course in the first quarter to contribute to a fixed-income trading performance at Goldman Sachs that was so unexpectedly soft that the stock tumbled as much as 5.8 percent on April 18. While currencies and commodities trading left an even bigger dent, the performance by Savarese -- and the bank’s entire credit desk -- has attracted attention because it contrasts with better results at rivals.', 'Savarese’s is a familiar tale in the business, where you can be riding high one minute and humbled the next.\xa0If the 39-year-old sold or reduced his holding in December, he could’ve locked in gains. Instead, the bank’s position in Peabody declined about $40 million this year, a person with knowledge of the matter said.', 'But Goldman Sachs has demonstrated an ability to stomach trades that work brilliantly and then, suddenly, don’t, showing how it still embraces a volatility in trading operations that’s out of favor on much of Wall Street. In the first quarter, gains on other positions helped compensate for the Peabody losses. In the end, the distressed desk was more profitable than during the same period last year, according to Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman.', 'Still, the bank’s total fixed-income trading revenue rose just 1 percent from a year earlier to $1.69 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates by about $340 million as rivals outpaced forecasts.', '“If those losses sustain for a long period and aren’t addressed, then you’ve got yourself a problem,”\xa0said\xa0Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS Group AG, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. “Investors were generally willing to give Goldman a pass on the first-quarter weakness, but if we see that translate into second-quarter or third-quarter weakness, then I think people will start to ask themselves far more fundamental questions.”', 'Read more: Goldman said to get burned by coal, retail in trading miss', 'Because Savarese did so well last year, the first-quarter miss may be viewed as just a blip,\xa0according to a person with knowledge of the internal politics. The person said support from Savarese’s boss,\xa0Justin Gmelich, global head of credit trading, hasn’t wavered.', 'Savarese and Gmelich declined to comment, according to DuVally, who said he wouldn’t discuss personnel or specific trades.', 'Under the Volcker Rule, the regulation named for former Federal Reserve Chairman\xa0Paul Volcker, banks with federally insured deposits are barred from betting their own money. Financial institutions must prove their bond inventory is used to meet client demands, which may mean holding positions for long periods.\xa0A person familiar with the bank’s policies said the trades were within the rule’s bounds.', 'DuVally, the spokesman, declined to comment on the Volcker Rule, but said that according to internal estimates, the bank was a market maker on about one-quarter of the Peabody Energy bonds traded in 2016. The bank also held some of the company’s secured debt.', 'Known for his work ethic, Savarese is often first to arrive at the office and last out at night, according to another person. Some mornings he works out beforehand with fellow traders, and he often takes junior analysts out for lunch to talk about their careers, the person said.', 'He wasn’t always so respected. After he departed Morgan Stanley for Goldman Sachs in late 2015, the buzz among his new colleagues -- and rivals -- was all about the fate of the distressed book he left behind, according to people who have worked or traded with him. The bank’s distressed bets helped contribute to a 42 percent decline in third-quarter bond-trading revenue that year, the people said, a tumultuous period that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman called the worst for fixed income at the firm since he took the top job in 2010. Savarese left just months before Gorman fired 25 percent of fixed-income traders and salespeople.', 'He landed at Goldman Sachs, where his older brother Jason is co-chief operating officer of the securities division, which houses the trading units, including the distressed-debt desk. Adam joined as a partner, one of the few people the bank has hired from a competitor at that level.', 'At the time, Goldman Sachs’s distressed-debt desk was in turmoil. Jerry Keefe and Dennis Lafferty, who had been co-heads of the group with Tom Tormey, both left after Tormey was elevated to partner. Keefe joined hedge fund CarVal Investors and Lafferty departed for HSBC Holdings Plc. Some time later, Tormey moved into a different role and handed oversight to Savarese.', 'In 2016, spurred by the Peabody bet, as well as a position in Ultra Petroleum Corp., his team brought in more than $200 million in revenue, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That came close to the performance turned in by Thomas Malafronte, Goldman Sachs’s star junk bond trader who was one of Wall Street’s best last year with about $300 million in revenue.', 'The Savarese brothers grew up on Long Island and attended St. Anthony’s High School, an athletics powerhouse in western Suffolk County. Adam Savarese wrestled at the Catholic school and was a member of the Tau fraternity, founded on the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, whose members volunteered at soup kitchens, according to Denise Creighton, director of alumni relations at St. Anthony’s who taught both brothers.', '“He wasn’t a brainiac but did very well in school because he worked very hard,” Creighton said of Adam Savarese. “I haven’t seen him since he graduated, but when you said his name I smiled.”', 'A skilled grappler, Savarese wrestled at James Madison University and joined Goldman Sachs after graduation. In 2002, he left for Morgan Stanley and rose to managing director, according to his LinkedIn profile.', 'Since returning to Goldman Sachs, he’s played an active role in the bank’s push to diversify its trading partners, doing more business with asset managers and corporations.

" The BBC's movie reviewers offer their top five movies of the summer, below.)",,"['The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.', 'At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.', 'Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.', 'Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.', 'The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.', 'The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.', 'Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.', 'Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.', 'In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.', 'Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”', 'That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.', 'As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.', 'Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.', 'If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.', 'Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.', 'One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.', 'There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I.']", The latest film and trailer news and reviews to help you find your summer movie. to and and and the and and the," As summer blockbuster movie is kick-launched, here is the rundown about some the biggest comic-screen characters to see the film in the upcoming year.", In this Preview section the editors describe what you may you have not already heard or knew about your summer superhero movies., A the upcoming film seasons from MarvelComics.," As summer blockbuster movie season kicks'off, a look in the reviews at the movie this summer''"," The BBC's movie reviewers offer their top five movies of the summer, below.)"

The French, on the other hand, enjoy nothing less than a high-minded, lofty debate over abstract concepts – or so it is believed. The British ask: “It works in theory, but does it work in practice?” The French ask: “It works in practice, but does it work in theory?” So the joke goes.', 'As a London-based French citizen watching my own country heading for a rancourous presidential runoff on 7 May and Britain preparing for its first post-Brexit general election, I’m not sure the supposed differences between us are as marked as we like to think. And I see lessons for the UK from what is happening across the Channel.', 'While you struggle to make sense of Brexit, we’re struggling with the looming catastrophe that would be the election of Marine Le Pen. And up against her in the second round, the 39-year-old centrist reformer, Emmanuel Macron, is our new national sensation. He wants to abolish the once watertight left-right divide, upending decades of ideological confrontation.', 'He’s no Robespierre. He quoted Albert Camus in one of his rallies earlier this month: “Each generation no doubt believes it is doomed to remake the world. The task of our generation may be even larger: it consists in preventing the world from coming undone.” So, not entirely unBritish.', 'This is not a perfect parallel. Though withdrawal from the EU is sad and costly, it’s unlikely to unravel British democracy. By contrast, the victory of a far-right leader in France would be the death of all the values the republic is meant to uphold. Brexit may be troublesome for EU citizens living in the UK – and there have even been several xenophobic attacks since 23 June – but a Le Pen win would put 7 million or so French nationals of African, Arabic or Muslim descent under constant physical threat. The bigotry that pervades her rallies would be unleashed nationwide. The country’s fragile social fabric, which terrorism has already torn at, would be ripped apart entirely.', 'If the polls are right, Macron should win. He hasn’t yet. But if his rise has proved something the British might do well to heed, it is that a robust political centre does have a chance against rightwing populism. The centre is not ineffective, and it’s not outdated. The old structures may crumble – and indeed the traditional postwar parties in France are all but wiped out – but that does not mean the extreme parts of the political spectrum will be the only ones to grow out of the ruins.', 'Radical rightwing politics has thrived by exploiting the popular rage that characterises the mood in France today (fuelled by joblessness and deep distrust of the elites). Nearly 50% of the electorate voted on 23 April for either the far left, the far right, or Trotskyist and maverick candidates. But so far, even against that sorry backdrop, a clearsighted, energetic Macron has come out on top.', 'He calls himself “progressive”, and stands for social liberalism, or pro-market social democracy. He’s not anti-capitalist nor anti-globalisation, and certainly not nativist. He’s the anti-radical who advocates step-by-step, moderate reform to heal the many fractures of an extremely tense and anxious country.

Witness Theresa May’s observation this week that 27 European countries are “lining up against” Britain.

One that would help counter the kind of narrative deployed by May; one that could soften Brexit. A left-leaning Labour offers little solace in that regard. The best antidote seems to be a confident centre, one built on pragmatic, moral, optimistic beliefs, and, as we see in France, rich in potential. If Macron prevails on 7 May, the immediate effect of his centre revolution will probably be felt in France.

There isn't much tape on the Ohio native, but he's shown the ability to make every throw and has a natural feel for the game. Trubisky's instincts are on point and he has what it takes to develop into a great quarterback at the professional level."", 'With signal-callers generally being hit-or-miss in the draft, even in the early rounds, Trubisky is the safest option at the position in 2017. That alone makes him more attractive to an organization like the Browns, which will have to shell out approximately $30.3 million with over $20 million as a signing bonus if they take the UNC product at No. 1.', ' North Carolina quarterback Mitch Trubisky (10) runs the ball during the first quarter of an NCAA college football game against Illinois, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016 at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Ill.

If that is the case, Trubisky stands to lose millions. Oddsmakers currently have the over/under on Trubisky's draft position set at 9.5, with a 68.5% chance of him being selected from No. 1 to No. 9 and 31.5% odds that he is picked at No. 10 or beyond. Should he fall to the Buffalo Bills at No. 10 a realistic landing spot Trubisky's deal would be valued at $16.4M, nearly $14 million less than he could make in Cleveland."", ""The latest Trubisky realistically comes off the board is No. 12, where the Browns own a second first-rounder by way of the Philadelphia Eagles. In an ideal world for Cleveland, the front office would be able to hedge the risk of selecting Trubisky by nabbing him at this draft slot. In this scenario, the team could take a much surer prospect at No. 1 such as Garrett and give him the big payday that comes with that honor. The Tar Heels QB would still be on the roster for the 2017 campaign, but at a vastly reduced price tag. The No. 12 draft pick this year will earn approximately $13.8M, with an $8.2 signing bonus making up the majority of that deal.

A minute of tape will tell you that this guy has all the skills of an NFL superstar, as well as a humble attitude and willingness to improve that franchises covet. While Garrett won't impact the game as much as a superstar quarterback could, the odds of him paying dividends on a $30+ million rookie contract are much higher than Trubisky."", ""Regardless of what happens on Thursday night, Trubisky, Garrett and the rest of the first-rounders are poised to become quite rich.
