" The problem is that many plastic surgeons fail to spot it, suggests a study.",,"['Nearly one in 10 patients seeking facial plastic surgery suffers from a mental illness that distorts their perception of physical defects, but doctors often don’t spot the problem, new research suggests.', 'Researchers found that plastic surgeons correctly identified the diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in less than 5 percent of patients who screened positive for the disorder.', 'According to published reports, many specialists suspect that the late superstar Michael Jackson -- who underwent repeated plastic surgeries that dramatically changed his appearance -- struggled with body dysmorphic disorder. Those affected with BDD, considered a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder, are overly preoccupied with perceived body defects that are actually miniscule and commonly involve the nose, eyes, skin or hair, the study authors said.', '“We all knew patients with BDD were in our practice, but we didn’t know the prevalence of it,” said study author Dr. Lisa Earnest Ishii. She’s an associate professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery in the division of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.', '“So one of the interesting findings was the high prevalence of BDD [our study] showed,” Ishii added. “The other surprise was just how poor we were as surgeons at picking it up.”', 'Prior research indicated that up to three-quarters of patients with body dysmorphic disorder consult plastic surgeons about cosmetic procedures, and up to six in 10 undergo unnecessary surgery to “fix” their perceived defects.', 'In the new study, Ishii and her team screened nearly 600 patients who sought facial plastic surgery consultations at three medical sites over 11 months. Patients were given a specialized questionnaire that determined if they had body dysmorphic disorder.', 'Despite how commonly the psychiatric condition was identified by the questionnaire -- almost 10 percent of patients screened positive -- only 4 percent of patients had been suspected of having the problem by plastic surgeons.', 'Ishii said she isn’t sure why more plastic surgeons didn’t suspect body dysmorphic disorder in their patients, but is concerned “we are inherently biased.”', '“We all went into this [field] with the goal of helping patients,” she added. “So I feel we are biased to think, ‘This patient just needs good help and I can provide that help, and if I just perform some kind of procedure on them, they will be better.’ I think our inherent bias prevents us from seeing what’s really there.”', 'But Ishii’s view was challenged by another plastic surgery expert. Dr. Rodney Rohrich, editor-in-chief of the journal\xa0Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, believes that many body dysmorphic disorder patients aim to deceive plastic surgeons about their obsession with their appearance.', '“One of the hallmarks of BDD patients is they don’t like to be found out,” said Rohrich, who is also a clinical plastic surgeon at the Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute. “If they’re found out, they leave. These patients are very smart -- most won’t even want to do this [BDD] questionnaire because they’re so smart.”', 'Ishii did not have data indicating how often the body dysmorphic disorder screening questionnaire is used by plastic surgeons nationwide, but noted that surgeons have typically felt “they do a very good job at screening for it.”', 'She was reluctant to suggest a policy that would mandate formal screening, but does think the questionnaire should become the standard of care among plastic surgeons.', '“The [questionnaire] is very easy to administer and incorporate into a busy practice, and given the patients we miss by not administering it, we stand a lot to gain,” Ishii said.', 'Rohrich said that patient privacy laws would prevent doctors from sharing knowledge about plastic surgery seekers, who may “doctor-shop” if one plastic surgeon turns them down for a procedure because of concerns about the psychiatric condition.', '“Every week we see patients like this, but they’re very smart and they go from one doctor to another,” he said. “But many times they’re also very nice, so they do eventually find a surgeon who will operate on them again. And many have the means and resources to do so.”', 'Ishii said plastic surgeons should refer suspected BDD patients to a psychiatrist with special expertise in the disorder. Rohrich said, however, that he feels the proper approach “is to never operate on these types of patients.”', '“I try to let them down softly. I try saying, ‘I don’t see what you see.’ Sometimes I just tell them, ‘I’m not good enough to give you the result you want,’ “ he said. “You have to be careful about that ... confronting them hasn’t worked well. I tried getting them to go to therapy, but they wouldn’t go.”', 'The new research was published online recently in\xa0JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.']"," plastic surgeons are often unable to identify a psychiatric condition that causes patients to seek plastic surgery, researchers say."," Plastic surgeons often fail to spot the mental illness that causes people to think they have body defects, a study suggests."," Doctors often do not know that patients who seek facial plastic surgery are at risk for a psychiatric condition that makes them think of the world differently, a study suggests.", A new study shows that many plastic surgeons are failing to spot patients who are suffering from a mental illness that distorts their perception of physical defects.," Many plastic surgeons are unable to spot an illness that makes patients feel they have small flaws in their bodies, a new study finds."," The problem is that many plastic surgeons fail to spot it, suggests a study."

" The new baseball year is about to begin, and here are seven things you might not have known before, as the New York Times' Rob Owen and the Los Angeles Times' Bob Nightengale write.",,"['We know already that the 2017 baseball season will be different, because we know what we’re missing. Gone are the soothing soundtrack of Vin Scully and the stylish slugging of David Ortiz. The persistent misery of the Chicago Cubs has gone poof. And we won’t have Ol’ A-Rod to kick around anymore, either.', 'But fear not. Here are six baseball men who’ve done it all, and still want to stay on the stage. They come from Ecuador and Canada, Japan and the Dominican Republic, California and North Carolina. They are the active leaders in hits, homers, strikeouts, games as an umpire, years in the broadcast booth and years as a major league coach.', 'They have seen the sport evolve, with home runs and strikeouts continuing to rise. Last season, a record 111 players hit at least 20 homers, while pitchers struck out 21.1 percent of opposing batters, the highest rate in history. That’s a whole lot of balls soaring over fences or being missed completely. All or nothing, boom or bust.', 'The folks depicted here – the Los Angeles Dodgers broadcaster Jaime Jarrin, the umpire Joe West, the Arizona Diamondbacks coach Dave McKay, the Los Angeles Angels slugger Albert Pujols, the Yankees left-hander C.C. Sabathia and the Miami Marlins outfielder Ichiro Suzuki — share an abiding love of the game, even as it changes. Serving it at the highest level continues to invigorate them.', '“We’re the custodians of the game,” West said, speaking for all who work within it. “This game isn’t ours, it’s America’s game — and we’re just here to protect it.”', 'Born Oct. 22, 1973, Nichi Kasugai-gun, Japan', '4,308 hits (1,278 in Japan, 3,030 in the United States) entering 26th season', 'In what other field could the master craftsman of his generation fail as often as Ichiro Suzuki? Across a quarter-century of baseball seasons, in Japan and in the majors, his batting average is .324. That sounds good, but consider this: he has exactly 9,000 hitless at-bats.', '“Trying to improve, trying to find it — that’s an everyday thing, over and over and over,” he said through an interpreter. “Even now, this year, my first day of spring training I was nervous. First day of spring training games, I was nervous. First game of the opening series, I’m going to be nervous. I’m not used to it, like: ‘It’s O.K.’ It’s still that new feeling every time.”', 'At 43 years old, after so many thousands of hits, Suzuki has no desire to stop chasing the unattainable. Even now, as a part-time outfielder for the Miami Marlins, he approaches every day as he always has.', '“He’s a lot like when I watched Derek over the years,” said Don Mattingly, Miami’s manager, referring to Derek Jeter. “He looked the same at the end as he did at the beginning, really. He didn’t get away from who he was.”', 'Suzuki arrived in 2001 as the first Japanese position player to also be a star in the majors. In each of his first 10 seasons with the Seattle Mariners, he made the All-Star team, won a Gold Glove, hit .300 and collected 200 hits. Yet only last season, when he finally crossed the 3,000-hit threshold in the majors, did he feel widespread recognition of his skills.', '“People looked at me differently,” he said. “When you leave good numbers, then people automatically accept you as a good player.”', 'Suzuki has hit only two home runs in two seasons with Miami, and just 114 for his career. Yet his raw power, saved mostly for batting practice, is so impressive that Giancarlo Stanton, the muscular Marlins right fielder, said Suzuki could have been a slugger if he chose to tailor his game that way.', 'Instead, he became the antithesis of the modern plodder who slows down today’s game with a so-called three-true-outcome approach (home run, strikeout or walk). For Suzuki, specialization was never an option.', '“Ever since I was little I wanted to become a professional baseball player,” he said, “and in order to do that, I thought that you had to be good at all the skill points that baseball has to offer – throwing, defense, hitting, running, all the tools that you need.”', 'More than any other player this century, Suzuki embodies the game the way it was first intended, when pitchers were merely surrogates to initiate a cunning, action-packed test of hitting, fielding and baserunning. He prefers baseball’s free-styling, unpredictable rhythms, and thinks players aren’t as heady as they were when he arrived.', '“We haven’t had that with the Marlins,” Suzuki said, “but it feels like we’re being controlled, like a video game, where people are using all sorts of different stuff to control the players.”', 'He laughs as he says this, but he’s serious, too. The new rule allowing a hitter to take his base on an intentional walk — without the pitcher throwing four balls – is nonsense to him.', '“Well, let’s say that’s a minute you’re shaving off,” he said. “During that period is a unique atmosphere where if you’re on deck, you have those four pitches to think about that at-bat. You’re taking that away completely now. Things like that mean a lot to baseball; the atmosphere you’re experiencing, the anticipation, all the things you usually would experience during those four pitches, now that’s gone.”', 'Who knows, he continues – maybe next baseball will eliminate the home run trot, since the ball’s already over the fence. For the career leader in worldwide major league hits, it’s all a bit much. The game has always been an exquisite masterpiece to Suzuki, who has made seven visits to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., where one day his plaque will reside.', '“At first it was like, ‘Oh, I want to see this or that,’ but after I’ve been many times, it’s not that I’m going for one reason or another, to see this person or that,” he said. “It just feels good to be there.”', 'Born Dec. 10, 1935, Quito, Ecuador', '59th season as a Dodgers broadcaster', 'The longest-serving broadcaster in baseball was a newsman first. His most challenging workday had nothing to do with rain delays, extra innings or flight delays. It was the funeral of President Kennedy in November 1963.', '“My English was extremely poor, and they sent me to cover the funeral without anything,” said Jaime Jarrin, the Spanish voice of the Dodgers since 1959. “I arrived in Washington — the first time for me there — 7 in the morning.’’', 'It was cold, he remembered, and the streets were filled with soldiers. “So what do I do?” he said.', 'Jarrin, now 81, did what all the greats do: He found a way to get the story. He had covered the Los Angeles City Council and knew Edward Roybal, who had just begun serving in the House of Representatives. He contacted Roybal and soon had all he needed: a car, a driver and radio equipment.', '“I was in the rotunda when Mrs. Kennedy came in to kneel in front of the body there,” he said. “I was broadcasting that. I broadcast the procession to the Arlington Cemetery. It was very difficult to do it, but I was able to do it. That was the toughest assignment I ever got.”', 'In its own way, baseball was not easy, either. In 1955, when Jarrin left Ecuador for Los Angeles at age 19, he had never seen a game. The Dodgers were still in Brooklyn, but Jarrin noticed the local fans’ passion for the sport. He was drawn to Pacific Coast League games around town, and read as much as he could about baseball.', 'When the Dodgers arrived for the 1958 season, Jarrin was the news and sports director at KWKW radio. The Dodgers’ owner, Walter O’Malley, wanted the station to call his team’s games, and gave a Jarrin a year to prepare. By 1959 he was ready, and with few other Spanish media outlets, he soon came to feel a powerful bond as the conduit from the team to Latinos.', '“Radio was the way that people became aware of everything,” Jarrin said. “I knew my job was to give them some type of entertainment, knowing that Latinos are very hard-working people. They work from early in the day until late at night, so after a hard day, they come home and what better entertainment to give them than the beautiful game of baseball, in their own language?”', 'His teacher and mentor, he said, was Vin Scully, who had joined the Dodgers’ broadcast team in Brooklyn in 1950. In the early years, Jarrin would broadcast only home games, but still had to re-create road games from a studio. Scully would call with the weather and other details to make Jarrin’s job easier.', 'Jarrin says his style is somewhat like Scully’s — calm and impartial, not a screamer, with plenty of stories and anecdotes, often culled from conversations with Spanish-speaking players. The biggest change in baseball, from his perspective, is the rising influence of Latin-American players, and the corresponding interest from fans.', 'When he started, Jarrin said, Latinos comprised 8 to 10 percent of Dodgers fans. Now they are nearly half. He can trace much of the team’s popularity to the rise of Fernando Valenzuela, the ace from Mexico who led the Dodgers to the 1981 championship.', '“It’s my opinion,” he said, “but Fernando is the one single ballplayer who has created more new baseball fans than any other.”', 'Valenzuela called games on radio with Jarrin for more than a decade before switching to television in 2015. Since then Jarrin has been paired with his son, Jorge, 60, who spent many years patrolling the skies as a traffic reporter for KABC.', '“That’s the greatest blessing that I have received, because I am now paying him back for the time that I was away so much,” Jarrin said. “I missed so many, many occasions.”', 'Jarrin allows himself a two-week vacation at midseason now, but otherwise he embraces the grind of the punishing schedule. His wife, Blanca, still supports his career, and he plans to finish his contract, which runs through 2018. That would give him 60 years calling games, but Jarrin thinks he might continue.', '“I love the game so much,” he said. “My wife told me, ‘You know, Jaime, if you retire you still will be going to the games, so you might as well get paid.’”', 'Born March 14, 1950, Vancouver, British Columbia', '34th season as a major league coach', 'Dave McKay never played high school baseball. Soccer and basketball were his sports, and he figured he would go to art school in Vancouver, his hometown. Yet somehow, baseball tugged at him — first in a summer league, then at a junior college, then at Creighton, where he was supposed to concentrate on basketball. McKay was not drafted, but he was good enough to sign with the Minnesota Twins as a free agent in 1971.', '“The whole thing at the beginning was I had no idea how the game was played, and I was so eager to learn,” McKay said. “I think back on what they would be saying: ‘You know what, he makes a mistake, but he doesn’t make it a second time. He listens.’”', 'McKay hit a home run in his first major league at-bat, in 1975, and lasted eight seasons as a utility infielder. He absorbed enough to become a major league coach, at age 34, for the Oakland A’s in 1984.', 'When Tony La Russa was named manager in mid-1986, McKay was the only coach he kept the next season. They also worked together for many years in St. Louis, and when La Russa retired after the 2011 season, McKay moved on to the Cubs. In 2014 he joined the Arizona Diamondbacks, surviving a staff shake-up last winter and returning to man the first-base box while specializing in outfield and baserunning instruction.', '“He pays so much attention to detail,” said Chris Owings, who switched from infield to outfield last season. “It really allows you, when you get out on the field, to just trust what he’s talking about.”', 'La Russa, now a Diamondbacks adviser, valued McKay for his communication skills, his knowledge, his thirst for learning and his toughness. In Oakland, McKay once confronted a slugger who was loudly whining about his batting-practice pitching.', '“Both teams were watching,” LaRussa said. “He walks up there and says, ‘Don’t you ever show me up!’ The guy backed down.”', 'La Russa did not name the hitter, but it might have been Jose Canseco, the home run king whose expose on steroids rocked the industry in 2005 and implicated a former teammate, Mark McGwire. McKay was the Athletics’ strength coach in 1988, when Canseco was at the height of his fame, and once wrote a book with him on weight training.', '“When I was defending McGwire, I said I guarantee there wasn’t a bit of it in our program, because Dave McKay would never allow it,” La Russa said. “Now, we’re not policemen. But that’s another thing about David that gets forgotten — he had more expertise than anyone about how to train with weights, functionally, for baseball. Then other guys got smart, but in the early A’s days, that was a huge edge of ours.”', 'McKay, 67, said staying in shape keeps him going. The stereotype of the grizzled, potbellied coach with tobacco drooling down his chin? That’s not him. McKay looks much younger than he is, and tailors his winter training to attack all the problems that threaten to wear him down. It’s working.', '“When I can’t jog to my position at first base, then I would probably say I’m done,” he said. “But I still throw every day, I hit fungoes. I do everything I did when I was in my 30s.”', 'As a player — for the Twins, the Toronto Blue Jays and the A’s — McKay was no speedster; he had just 20 stolen bases in 32 attempts. But he learned to be acutely aware of game situations, and has spent decades passing on the finer points of baserunning. For his teams, it is not a lost art.', '“Some come into the game and they just take it for granted, like one base at a time,” McKay said. “They’re deciding to get to first base, but how do I get to second base? There’s a lot of ways you can get there as long as you’re looking for someone to make a mistake and you’re that type of player. Putting pressure on the opposition, going first to third, turning a single into a double — those are exciting plays.”', 'McKay missed that excitement in his formative years. He thrives on it now, as baseball’s forever coach.', 'Born Jan. 16, 1980, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic', '591 home runs entering 17th season', 'Of the 27 players in major league history with 500 home runs, 23 struck out at a higher rate than Albert Pujols. The three who did not were Ted Williams, Mel Ott and Hank Aaron. None has played a game in the last 40 years.', 'For two generations, then, Pujols has been almost a singular force in baseball: the prodigious slugger who will not strike out. In 2001, when he was the National League Rookie of the Year for the Cardinals, he fanned 93 times. Since then, his season high is 76. Pitchers keep getting better, and time keeps wearing on Pujols. Yet he just keeps connecting.', '“It’s Albert,” said Mike Trout, his star Angels teammate. “You can’t put anything past him.”', 'Pujols, 37, is halfway through the 10-year, $240 million contract he signed after carrying St. Louis to the 2011 World Series title. He hit .328 as a Cardinal, with a .420 on-base percentage and a .617 slugging percentage. As an Angel, those figures have dipped to .266, .325 and .474.', 'Yet Pujols still plays almost every day, and returned to exhibition games in March after undergoing plantar fascia surgery on his right foot in December. He hit 31 homers last season and ranked third in the American League in runs batted in.', '“People say that I struggled, but I still drove in 119 runs,” he said. “If you tell me I’m gonna do that this year, I’d take it right away. I think what happens is you raise the bar so high that people expect you to do that every year — and this game is not easy, man. It’s tough, and there’s a lot of adjustments you have to make.”', 'Technology has helped with those adjustments. When he arrived, Pujols said with a laugh, he would watch his at-bats on videocassette tapes, and now coaches send them to his iPad. Those files show more sophisticated pitchers; most relievers have advanced beyond the predictable fastball/slider mix, and nearly everyone throws a cutter.', 'Yet Pujols’s swing still works, helped greatly by his uncanny ability to identify pitches. When the Angels’ players took their physical exams in February, Pujols aced the vision test yet again.', '“The doctor told me: ‘You still have eyes like eagles,’” he said. “So any time the doctor can tell you that, it’s a good thing.”', 'Pujols keeps the barrel of his bat in the strike zone longer than most hitters, and said he tries to take the same aggressive swing with two strikes as he does on other counts. He once had a high leg kick but rarely hits that way anymore. Mainly he tries to stay simple – or quiet, as hitters say – in the box and not think of his mechanics.', '“My main goal is to just let the ball travel, like everybody else,” Pujols said. “With two strikes, for the most part, I really, really let that ball travel, because I feel like I still have quick enough hands to get the bat around.”', 'Jesse Chavez, a new teammate, has faced Pujols 21 times without ever striking him out. Chavez called Pujols the toughest hitter in baseball to face because he offers no safe areas to the pitcher. Even the less-fearsome version of Pujols cannot be removed from his comfort zone. He can still hit your best pitch.', '“You can’t go in, you can’t go out, you can’t go up, you can’t go down,” Chavez said. “It’s like: where do we go?”', 'Pujols is going to places few hitters ever have; he will soon become just the ninth player ever with 600 home runs. Three in the club (Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez and Sammy Sosa) have been tainted by their ties to steroids. Pujols has aggressively — and successfully – beaten back any suspicions leveled at him.', '“I’m like, ‘Hey, prove it,’” Pujols said. “I fear God too much and I fear what I have done in this game too much to do something that would ruin my reputation, whether it’s on the field or off the field. Does that make me perfect? No, I’m not perfect, because I have made mistakes since I was a young little boy. But through God I’m able to have his grace, and I have a great wife, a great family and great people around the game who have helped me.”', 'Baseball’s most prolific active slugger does not think much of milestones, he insists. But he is proud of how he got here.', 'Born July 21, 1980, Vallejo, Calif.', '2,726 strikeouts entering 17th season', 'At Yankee Stadium and at Steinbrenner Field in spring training, the corner locker belongs to C.C. Sabathia. From there he can see all the players coming and going, in and out of the Yankees’ orbit, as he enters his ninth season in pinstripes. One day this spring, another big left-hander noticed him there and said hello.', 'It was Sam McDowell, 74, who was visiting the Yankees on behalf of the Baseball Assistance Team. Decades ago, McDowell was a hard-throwing, dominant ace for the Cleveland Indians. He shares those traits with Sabathia, and another: both are recovering alcoholics. They shared a few words, casually, about the ongoing fight.', '“I wouldn’t be able to pitch if I was still drinking — at this age, the way my body feels,” Sabathia said. “So I’m blessed in the way I got a chance to be able to right that ship and keep going with my career.”', 'Sabathia, now in his 17th season over all, left the Yankees before the 2015 wild card game to get treatment for his addiction. He returned last season and had his best performance in four years, making 30 starts with a 3.91 earned run average. He is hardly a No. 1 starter anymore, but he competes.', 'When Sabathia joined the Yankees in 2009, he immediately led them to a World Series title. He learned a lot then by watching Andy Pettitte, who was 36 at the start of that season, just as Sabathia is now. Sabathia did not need to be crafty then, but banked the lessons for later.', '“When I got here and met Andy was when I started learning that I’m probably gonna have to transition to this type of pitcher to be successful in the big leagues,” he said.', 'Like Mike Mussina before him, Sabathia recognized that his legacy would not be defined by his work with his first team, but by how he handled the back half of his career, as a Yankee. After four terrific seasons, Sabathia had three far below his standards as he dealt with declining velocity, knee trouble and his struggle with alcohol.', 'Now, armed with Pettitte’s cutter to give some late life to his ordinary fastball, he has found a new groove. He swears he doesn’t miss his old heat.', '“I don’t,” Sabathia said. “I like where I’m at. This is a lot of fun, being able to pitch like this, thinking through games, setting guys up and trying to get called strikeouts and stuff. It’s a lot more fun to than just going out there and kind of beating them with brute force.”', 'So many pitchers do that now, many more than when Sabathia first arrived. Bullpens especially are stocked with hard throwers, and starters reach the majors with more weapons than Sabathia had in 2001.', '“When I came up I was 97 to 100 with just a curveball,” he said. “That’s all I had. These guys come up now, they have good changeups, they have cutters, they have sliders. I had two pitches.”', 'They served him very well: Sabathia went 17-5 as a rookie, and two years later made the first of six All-Star teams. In 2007 he won the American League Cy Young Award and faced Boston in Game 5 of the championship series, at home, with a chance to give the Indians the pennant. He lost, and he’s never gotten over it.', '“We’d have definitely won the World Series if I would have pitched a lot better than I did,” said Sabathia, who allowed four runs and 10 hits in six innings of a 7-1 loss. “If I would have pitched in ’07 the way I did in ’09 in the playoffs, we would have won the World Series.”', 'Indeed, in his next A.L.C.S., with the Yankees, Sabathia was named most valuable player. Soon, he won a ring.', '“I got it,” he said, “but I wish I would have done it for Cleveland.”', 'Sabathia wants to keep pitching beyond this season, when his contract expires. He needs 274 strikeouts to become the 17th pitcher in history to reach 3,000. He insists, with a smile, that it will not mean much to him.', '“Nah,” he said. “Somebody’ll say I pitched too long, that’s why I got it. So it doesn’t make a difference, you know what I mean?”', 'Born Oct. 31, 1952, Asheville, N.C.', '4,942 games entering 40th season as a major league umpire', 'Sometime this season, Joe West will work his 5,000th game as a major league umpire. Only two men have worked more: Bill Klem (5,375) and Bruce Froemming (5,163). West’s mother grew up on a farm and his father was a schoolteacher. He said his strong work ethic comes naturally.', 'West, 64, also started young, and got quite a sight the first time he called balls and strikes in the majors. After working the bases his first three games, West had the plate at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on Sept. 16, 1976. The matchup: the Braves’ Phil Niekro – a master knuckleballer — against Joaquin Andujar of the Houston Astros.', '“That was the first knuckleball I had ever seen, and then the other guy was throwing as hard as anybody in the league,” West said. “So I had one guy throwing butterflies up there and the other guy throwing rockets.”', 'If Niekro and Andujar symbolized the ends of the pitching spectrum, West has seen everything in between across the last four decades. Joe Torre, the first manager West ever ejected, noted with a smile that West started umpiring before Torre had retired as a player.', '“He cares about the game, sometimes a little bit too much, where he goes outside the box,” said Torre, who oversees umpires now as the league’s chief baseball officer. “He’s always been a stickler for getting everything right, even to the point of being a nudge. But over all, he comes to work every day and he’s excellent in the postseason. They all miss stuff during the season, but in postseason, he’s one of the better ones.”', 'West has umpired 25 postseason rounds, including six World Series. He was behind the plate the night the Yankees won the title in 2009, and also for Game 6 of the 2004 A.L.C.S., when Alex Rodriguez slapped the ball from the glove of Boston pitcher Bronson Arroyo. Rodriguez thought he was safe at second, and the Bronx fans unloaded on the umpires for calling him out.', '“They threw everything in the book at us,” West said. “We had to call the riot squad out to the field to continue the game.’’', 'West thinks back fondly on those moments, and on the pitchers who would tip their cap or acknowledge him when leaving a game, even while losing: Greg Maddux, Tim Wakefield, Roger Clemens, Curt Schilling, Jamie Moyer. As for the complainers, he learned long ago not to be ruffled, through simple but profound advice from the Hall of Fame umpire Doug Harvey.', '“Don’t let him ruin your day,” Harvey told West. “If he gets out of line, you can kick him out, but don’t let him get you upset. You’ve got a job to do.”', 'West has lived by those words. A quarterback in college at Elon and a four-term president of the umpires’ union, he is used to taking a commanding, authoritative presence with him to the field. In the off-seasons he takes a different stage, as a country music singer; his website sells original CDs, as well as umpire equipment he designs for Wilson. More than 90 percent of umpires wear his patented West Vest.', '“We haven’t had anybody break a bone wearing one of my chest protectors,” West said. “We’ve had bruises, but nobody’s broken a bone yet.”', 'The job has changed in 40 years, of course. Replay can correct missed calls, but West is glad that umpires now tend to take a moment longer to get their calls right. The umpires, who once belonged to different leagues, have been under one major league umbrella since a failed mass-resignation strategy in 1999. West, one of dozens who resigned, was rehired in 2002.', 'The current labor agreement with the umpires runs three more years, and West would like to negotiate another before he retires. More than his upcoming milestone, West says, he is focused on leaving the state of umpiring in better shape than he found it.', '“You have three responsibilities,” West said, repeating his advice to colleagues. “Your first is to the game of baseball, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the commissioner’s office. Your second is to your profession, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the union, it means the profession. And the third responsibility is to do in your heart what you know is honest, moral and correct.

Our panel responds to the latest Brexit development', 'If seizing back sovereignty meant anything, then parliament is supreme. Now MPs must seize the day to ensure they debate and decide at every stage in the Brexit process. No more floundering and prevaricating, this is the time for MPs to lay down the law with strong red line amendments to the bill triggering article 50.', 'Start out in the right frame of mind, with warmth and goodwill to our European friends and neighbours. Declare unequivocal, unilateral and unconditional love for all our EU citizens resident here, welcoming them to stay with open arms – and get it written into this bill. Just do it. Because we want them and we need them and because surely that will secure the safety of the 1.2 million Brits in their lands. Start out in a spirit of solidarity and these negotiations will be better-natured than many fear. And add in a plea for universal EU visa-free travel, for God’s sake.', 'For Ireland’s sake, write an amendment committing to a soft border, which is urgent as the Northern Ireland constitution teeters perilously.', 'What of all those 32 EU agencies we should be sorry to leave? Add in amendments declaring at least an aim to stay in Interpol, the EU environment agency, the marine and aviation agencies, and keeping all current invaluable EU protections for our citizens. “No one worse off” should be a founding principle enshrined here, as the supreme court ruling suggests.', 'Before triggering this bill, we must know how the story ends. What if the final Brexit deal is so bad parliament simply can’t pass it? What if the EU parliament at the last fence votes it down? Before any MP presses this trigger, each one must know, written into the bill, that this is never irrevocable. Let no MP commit a gross dereliction of duty by signing blindly, obediently, with no clue as to what it means or where it may lead. Taking back control begins here.', 'The most over-enthusiastic people on each side of the Brexit divide have a vested interest in overstating the importance of this case. However, those remainers and leavers who respectively dream and fume that it will prevent Brexit are simply wrong.', 'Everyone has a right to have their legal claims heard – even those who hope to use the law as a form of political rearguard action. But this exercise is far more interesting in terms of constitutional law than in terms of politics. As president of the supreme court Lord Neuberger said, the judgment has nothing to do with whether the UK should leave the EU, or the terms on which we do so.', 'The ruling is fair enough. As a leaver, I wanted parliament to be sovereign once more. That parliament must vote to leave the EU is not a problem in either theory or practice.', 'What will happen next? The government will present a Brexit bill, which it has been preparing for some months. MPs will vote for that bill – the vast majority of Tories because they believe in implementing the referendum result, the majority of Labour MPs because they fear the retribution of their own voters if they try to defy them.', 'Peers may delay the bill, but they won’t block it – not least because it would be unwise for an unelected chamber to pit itself against the largest vote in British political history. At worst, the government can use the Salisbury convention; the Conservative manifesto pledged to “honour the result” of the referendum.', 'The fact the devolved administrations failed to secure a veto on Brexit, and the apparent rejection of deputy president Brenda Hale’s idea that a short bill would be insufficient to replace the 1972 European Communities Act, reinforce what was already clear: article 50 will still be triggered.', 'The supreme court, deeply conscious of the divisions and rancour that the high court judgment led to in the national debate, has sought to pre-empt similar fury by setting out in the clearest terms that the legal issue had nothing to do with “the wisdom of the decision to withdraw from the European Union, the terms of withdrawal, the timetable or arrangements for withdrawal, or the details of any future relationship with the EU”. All of that remains live, and should be on the table, as the debate now is turned back across Parliament Square.', 'Like the high court before it, the supreme court has lent its strong support to our centuries-long constitutional tradition of parliamentary sovereignty. Rights are bound to be impacted by withdrawal, and the court recognises that withdrawal from the EU will constitute fundamental constitutional change.', 'A big question for parliament now is how it tackles the issue of withdrawal and removal of rights, and whether it does so through the bill that Theresa May is settling as we speak, or whether it insists on clarity for the great repeal bill and a white paper setting out how and what rights will be lost, amended or retained.', 'The biggest disappointment will come to those hoping that the court would rule a practical blow to Brexit by the need for formal involvement of the devolved nations. Unanimously, the court ruled against that by concluding that although the devolution legislation assumed that the UK would remain a member of the EU, it did not go further and require the UK to remain a member of the EU. This may yet bring to bear its own political demons as the political fallout over a hard Brexit deepens.', 'The judgment is carefully worded, less critical than that of the high court, but nonetheless reminds the nation that parliament was careless with the wording of the 2015 Referendum Act, which the court unsurprisingly concludes simply did not provide for a change in the law of the land. That inherent failure of parliament, and David Cameron’s government, paves the way for the new law that must be drafted. Those drafting it this time, for all the talk of unamendable bills, would be well advised to avoid further appeals and confusion by ensuring that any bill is carefully drafted, and properly debated. A constitutional change of this order should not be hurried.', 'Some expect leavers like me to have a problem with this judgment. But I won’t hear of talk of “undemocratic judges” or “establishment stitch-ups”.', 'Don’t forget, we voted on 23 June to go back to being a self-governing democracy under the rule of law. The supreme court has not “blocked Brexit”, all the judges have done is clarify the law. It is now for the government to operate under the framework it has laid down. That is not something to berate – that’s the hallmark of a mature democracy.', 'As a campaigner for Brexit, I do not see the application of democracy and due process as an obstacle – indeed I don’t expect this decision to even slow down the process. Why?', 'MPs and Lords know that a refusal to implement the decision made by a majority of the British public last year would erode trust in democratic institutions. Many MPs also know that, if they vote against article 50, they will be voting against their own constituents. The leave campaign won more votes than any campaign in British history. Had it been a general election, leave would have won over 400 seats in the House of Commons, and we’d all be calling it a landslide victory.', 'And the Lords? They know that if they vote down Brexit they risk making radical reform of the Lords the public’s No 1 priority. Ultimately, an acceptance that the democratic will of the public has to be respected combined with a natural sense of self-preservation will see both houses vote for article 50.', 'Last month, MPs voted to trigger article 50 within the government’s timetable in a non-binding motion. The polls show that more people than ever before think that Brexit should happen. The political forces are overwhelmingly behind us leaving, and parliamentarians know that there is no mandate to block Brexit.', 'The judges have done their job, now it’s time for politicians to do theirs.']", The government is expected to set out plans to begin the formal process of the UK's departure from the European Union on Wednesday after a Supreme Court ruling on triggering article 50., Key points from the Supreme Court ruling on how the UK should trigger the process for leaving the EU.," Following the Supreme Court ruling that MPs must vote on whether the UK leaves the EU, BBC News asks politicians and commentators what the next step should be and what they want the government to do.", A panel of commentators on BBC News online have set out their top 10 Brexit tips following the Supreme Court ruling., A collection of tweets from journalists and political commentators after the Supreme Court ruled MPs must vote before triggering Article 50.," The BBC's parliamentary panel looks at what MPs should do in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, to secure a smooth Brexit.."

(2) Finance with fixed-rate debt. (3) Wait for inflation.', ""Leveraged real estate has created many an American fortune. It worked in the late 1970s, when rising inflation caught lenders flat-footed and delivered windfalls to property owners. It could work again, if fiscal policy reignites inflation. That could happen. President-elect Trump has in mind trillions of dollars of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In fact, his fiscal policies could do more to build the Trump family's wealth than all the business self-dealing that the press and good-government watchdogs are obsessing over."", 'Unexpected inflation creates winners and losers. Borrowers--you, if you have a fixed-rate home mortgage--take home gains. Lenders--you again, if there are long-term bonds in your retirement account--suffer losses.', 'Big investors bet on rising prices by acquiring debt-financed apartment buildings and commercial real estate. Small investors can do it by owning real estate investment trusts. And what better time to own REITs, says Robert G. Smith, who oversees $12 billion in portfolios at Sage Advisory in Austin, Texas, than when you have one of the most prolific builders as your president.', 'Investor excitement following the election came in a spurt for some sectors. Drugmakers and banks enjoyed a relief rally on the expectation that regulations will be relaxed. Companies that would capture road-building dollars, like Caterpillar and Vulcan Materials, had their run-ups.', 'The postelection rally left real estate out. Equity REIT shares are now off 14% from their July peak, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.', ""What's going on? Income investors, despairing of the tiny yields on Treasurys, were turning in desperation to riskier assets like REITs. When the yield on the ten-year Treasury started an ascent from its 1.4% low in July, REIT yields climbed as well. That sent their share prices down. But perhaps investors have confused nominal and real yields."", 'Inflation raises nominal yields on conventional mortgages and bonds, as bondholders seek compensation for being repaid in shrunken dollars. But an income stream from real estate is closer to a postinflation return, explains Jean-Michel Wasterlain, chief executive of Capfundr, a New York City real estate fund manager. A rising CPI eventually pushes up both the rents that a property owner collects and the price that the asset would fetch in a sale.', 'Wasterlain has data to prove the point. He compared yields on Treasury bonds and net rental yields (called capitalization rates) on investment real estate over the past 37 years. When inflation drove up the nominal yields on bonds and drove down bond prices, it did not push up real estate yields or push down real estate prices in like manner. Average cap rates have mostly kept inside a range of 6% to 9%, even as the yield on the ten-year Treasury lurched between 2% and 14%.', ""Inflation expectations are rising (see chart, above). Predictably, the bond market is in retreat. But property values are holding up, Wasterlain says. Indeed, far from damaging property values, inflation would help property owners who have paid for their assets in part with fixed-rate debt. Their rents climb, but their mortgage payments don't."", 'Inflation winners should include equity REITs (the ones that own buildings, as opposed to mortgages). The average equity REIT has debt equal to 31% of the value of its assets, according to the REIT association. A lot of this debt is at fixed rates, Wasterlain says.', ""The largest REIT exchange-traded fund is Vanguard's (VNQ). You could also look for an inflation shield in funds that own commodities (DBC), gold bullion (IAU), goldmine shares (GDX) or inflation-protected Treasury bonds (SCHP)."", ""The borrowing class includes homeowners. If you believe that Trump is going to do what he says he's going to do with spending and tax cuts, says Wasterlain, you should leverage your home. Borrow as much as you can at 4% because in a few years interest rates will be higher and property values will be higher."", ""Debt, of course, comes with risk. Expected inflation may never arrive; past warnings about inflation, made on these pages and elsewhere, have not yet been vindicated. REITs have their own hazards, reflecting the fact that they are more sensitive than property values are to what's going on in the stock market. The prices of equity REITs crashed 67% in the last downturn."", ""But you can get some reassurance from the fact that one important person has reason to root for inflation's return.

He just would have gotten bigger.""', ""Barnes, an influential sports agent who once called Ndamukong Suh a client and was a member of Purdue's 1980 Final Four squad, agreed to bring Swanigan to Fort Wayne if he could raise him as a son and adopt the 13-year-old. Swanigan moved to live with a man he'd met only a few times as a kid hanging around his older brother. Swanigan told Barnes that he'd never spent more than a year at the same school because of all the moves. He wanted stability. Barnes could grant that wish."", 'But it did not take long for Barnes to recognize the difficulties ahead.', '""The first day he was there, I told him to get up in the morning and eat breakfast,"" Barnes said.

""I just knew sometimes he\'d look in the trash can and he would say something [if he found them].""', 'But Swanigan craved the structure Barnes offered. He just needed time to embrace the new responsibilities with a new guardian in a new home and a new lifestyle.', 'Barnes, whom Swanigan calls Dad, took him to a cardiologist to gauge his capacity to endure stressful workouts.', 'After doctors cleared Swanigan, Barnes took him to the gym and challenged him with workouts he used to evolve into a three-sport standout at Purdue (football, basketball and baseball) and a 10th-round pick of the Detroit Lions in 1982. Barnes said he knew Swanigan would rise because he engaged every drill. He never said no. Although the 360-pound teenager needed an extra minute or two to complete each drill, he had the attitude and intellect of a pro, Barnes said.', ""When they ran 17s -- 17 sprints from sideline to sideline -- he could see the youngster's heart."", '""When you\'re in excellent shape, you can do it in a minute, with a minute\'s rest,"" Barnes said. ""When we first started doing it, it used to take Biggie 3 minutes and 50 seconds to do it. The thing that impressed me was that he never quit.""', ""Barnes addressed Swanigan's eating habits. More cooked meals, less fast food. Fewer sweets. The occasional pizza. A bowl of cereal, not the entire box."", ""The adoption process took three years to complete because the state's adoption officials could not initially find Swanigan's mother and father to sign the paperwork. They also wanted proof Barnes, a single man, could care for Swanigan.

Barnes, who also has three adult children, did not adopt Swanigan to baby a 360-pound, middle school kid.', 'They dreamed of making him the ""greatest power forward in the world,"" only a fantasy if Swanigan refused discipline. Swanigan said he didn\'t mind the discipline. But could he trust Barnes? Could he trust anyone? He nearly returned to Utah his sophomore season in high school.', '""Naturally, you just want to build up a wall when something changes,"" Swanigan said.

Yes, Barnes wanted Swanigan to attend his alma mater, but the Purdue standout said he de-committed from Michigan State and picked the Boilermakers because he knew he could play power forward with Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons on the roster, and figured Tom Izzo would make him play center."", ""It's more complicated than that, Barnes admits. There were rumors Swanigan demanded a personal chef. Not true. Barnes admits he requested a living situation that would allow Swanigan to live off campus and far from the junk food circulating most college dorms."", '""I told everyone, \'How Biggie is going to be used is No. 1,\'"" Barnes said.

Why tempt him and put him with the general population when the average freshman gains 15 to 20 pounds?""', 'Barnes said Michigan State did not provide adequate responses to those requests, so Swanigan told him he wanted to reopen his recruitment because those living guidelines followed ""the process"" they\'d imagined since he arrived.', 'At Purdue, Barnes pays for Swanigan to live alone in his one-bedroom apartment near Mackey Arena.', ""Today, he's a 19-year-old pro prospect averaging 18.5 points per game and 12.5 rebounds, while connecting on 78 percent of his free throws and 47 percent of his 3-point attempts.

Thompson] have played too much to be struggling with ball screen stuff,"" he told reporters after the game -- the big man looked at Josh Bonhotal, Purdue\'s assistant director of sports performance. Bonhotal understood and prepared to open the weight room.', '""He said, \'Josh, I\'m coming up,\'"" Bonhotal recalled. ""He went to the Stairmaster. That\'s his mindset.""', ""Swanigan's grit never wavered as he cut more than 100 pounds off his frame in six years -- he has dropped 15 more in college.

Then they work on explosive drills and lifts."", '""He\'s doing all this,"" Bonhotal said, ""before he goes out to practice.""', ""Bonhotal connects Swanigan's improvement on the court to the process he underwent years ago. Bonhotal said he has only refined the tools the projected second-round pick had when he arrived and tweaked his physical gifts."", ""This year, Swanigan has boosted the speed of his hang snatch, where he raises a weighted barbell off the ground and over his head as quickly as possible. He's also a tenth of a second faster on his box jumps. He sprints harder, too."", '""This has allowed him to react much quicker and really take advantage of his length in getting to balls above the rim,"" Bonhotal said.', 'Swanigan knows, however, that he nullifies the work if he fails to eat right.', ""So he's consistent."", 'Breakfast?', '""I generally just try to eat oatmeal or something like that for breakfast, get the day going.""', 'Lunch?', '""Something really small since we always practice at 2 p.m. I don\'t like eating big before practice, so I never really have a lunch.

I\'m not too big on starches.""', 'Haas, Purdue\'s 7-foot-2, 290-pound center, not only challenges Swanigan in practice, he also blocks him when it\'s time to eat. If he catches Swanigan piling an unhealthy entrée onto his plate, he\'ll tease him with an ""Ahhhhh, Biggie!"" and the sophomore will return the favor if he sees Haas gobbling junk. As big men, their bodies demand more care, Haas said. Bad food ruins their oversized engines and extends recovery time.', '""You don\'t want to put regular gas in a Lamborghini,"" Haas said. ""As a very fine-tuned machine, you have less room for error as a big guy. Whenever you eat like crap as a big guy, you\'re gonna feel like crap when you\'re on the court.

""He\'s been selective as a perimeter shooter. He was a good defensive rebounder last year. His improvement lies in his ability to go every single time.""', 'He proved that in the overtime loss to Minnesota and the late-night workout that followed.', 'Sometimes Swanigan reflects on his journey, which he often omits in conversations with teammates and friends. But he calls his experiences -- the eating issues, the stops in shelters, the constant relocation, the family turmoil, the academic woes -- ""fuel"" for his improvement.', ""There is a difference in Swanigan, however, that the box scores will never capture.

Jaded folks often assume, because someone is positive, that they’ve lived a privileged life. Sure, that may be, but you don’t know what someone else has experienced.

Days after one of the most blatantly racist and deadly attacks in recent memory, the families of the victims stood in front of the shooter and forgave him.', 'They, too, cited faith in God as the reason they could forgive.', 'The sister of Depayne Middleton Doctor, one of the people killed in the attack, said it this way, “For me, I’m a work in progress.

" The World Economic Forum is returning to Davos, Switzerland, and while attendees are often left shaking their heads, others are asking whether the annual event has lost its sense of purpose.",,"['Kenneth Rogoff can pinpoint the moment he started to grow concerned Donald Trump would be the next U.S. president: It was when Rogoff’s fellow attendees at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting last January said it could never happen. “A joke I’ve told 1,000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,” says the Harvard professor and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. “No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is.”', 'The repeated failure of business and political elites to predict what’s coming—last year, that included the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union—doesn’t strike those returning this month to the Swiss Alps as very funny. After a year in which political upsets roiled financial markets and killed off the careers of once-dominant Davos-going politicians, the concern for delegates attending this year’s meeting isn’t that their forecasts are often wrong, but that their worldview is.', 'In its four decades of existence, the WEF has nurtured a broad consensus in favor of globalization and open markets. At its core is the notion that capital, goods, and people should be able to move freely across borders, a principle that can deliver huge benefits to those with education and money but seems terrifying to those without either. For the 3,000 people who will convene in the small Swiss town from Jan. 17 to 20, the 2017 event could be a moment of reckoning. At speakers’ podiums, coffee bars, and the ubiquitous late-night parties, they’ll be asking themselves whether Davos has become, at best, the world’s most expensive intellectual feedback loop—and, at worst, part of the problem. “Since the recession, the boom has benefited the upper-income earners and done little for those in the middle or on less. That’s the backlash,” says Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist for research provider IHS Markit. “The Davos vision of the world has not delivered a broad-based economic recovery.”', 'That the world is entering an era of populism that could tear apart long-established global bonds is beyond question. The result of the Brexit vote threatens the U.K.’s most important trading relationships. In the U.S., Trump will take office this month having pledged to reopen trade deals and reevaluate bedrock foreign policy principles such as the so-called One China policy. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned in December after voters rejected proposed constitutional changes.', 'In France, hard-right leader Marine Le Pen leads opinion polls going into this spring’s presidential election. And in Germany, where elections also loom, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party has sought to capitalize on mounting opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door policy for refugees fleeing Mideast war zones, which some believe has left the country vulnerable to terrorist attacks such as the one in Berlin on Dec. 19. Almost a third of bond investors surveyed last month by Bank of America Merrill Lynch identified populism as their biggest concern, up from 9 percent in October.', 'Collectively, anti-establishment forces may represent the greatest threat to what historian Samuel Huntington called “Davos Man,” a cross-border species whose values and interests are often divorced from those of more insular compatriots. While each populist movement is unique, all share a generalized disdain for elites, however defined—and by extension, the economic prescriptions they promote. Huntington, who died in 2008, may have divined the future when he said Americans might eventually rebel against rising immigration, especially from Mexico, and the growing influence of multinational businesses and intellectuals.', 'Some Davos regulars worry those sentiments will lead the U.S. and other nations down a dark path. “The last time that we had a convergence of fear of globalization, fear of economic stagnation and poverty, fear of the international, it was after the 1929 crash,” says Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University and a frequent Davos visitor. “We really have to learn the lessons of the 1930s.”', 'This year’s conference agenda makes clear the degree of anxiety. Sessions include a panel of psychology experts offering thoughts on “cultivating appropriate emotions in a time of nationalist populism.” Another, titled “Squeezed and Angry: How to Fix the Middle Class Crisis,” will star International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde alongside hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. Separately, Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and Meg Whitman, chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, will try to stoke optimism in a chat about shaping “a positive narrative for the global community.”', 'The most talked-about guest will undoubtedly be Chinese President Xi Jinping, who’s attending for the first time. He’ll be pitching a Chinese-led rival to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed pan-Asian trade deal that died with Trump’s election. It’s an irony of the times that it’s Communist-run China that’s promoting free trade.', 'Davos veterans are meanwhile trying to foster a global capitalism that’s more in tune with the global mood. The IMF’s Lagarde said in December she wants a “move toward globalization that has a different face, and which is not excluding people along the way.” BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said in an interview that it’s important “there be some repositioning to show Davos can make a contribution to dealing with the fundamental issue of inequality of opportunity.”', 'All is far from lost for the Davos set. Critics predicted the death of the Davos consensus after the 2008 global financial crisis, only for the conclave’s prominence to continue to rise as the masters of the universe kept showing up. Global equities have rallied since Trump’s election, with the benchmark MSCI World Index nearing record highs, as investors bet that his administration will pursue an expansionary fiscal policy and slash regulations on industries such as finance. Trump may not be an adherent of the liberal internationalism preached at Davos, but he could prove quite beneficial to its proponents’ bank balances, at least in the short term.', 'What’s more, his cabinet is packed with individuals who would be much more comfortable on the Swiss town’s central promenade than at, say, a Wisconsin Walmart. Trump’s National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, is well-known at Davos because of his former life as president of Goldman Sachs. Another Trump confidant, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, has traditionally hosted one of the event’s best-attended annual parties.', 'The bottom line: The Davos consensus nurtured by four decades of World Economic Forum meetings is at best broken and at worst dead.']", The World Economic Forum in Davos is a strange place to predict.," This year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland is under way, yet experts warn it may be the event's worst since its launch in 1973."," In the fourth and final part of our series on Davos, The Wall Street Journal's Andrew Walker and Richard Black discuss the disconnect between what delegates and speakers at the World Economic Forum are told and what actually happens in their worlds."," After the World Economic Forum kicks off in Davos later this month, the BBC's Tomi Kilgore looks at what the annual gathering of the world's political and business elite will mean for our world."," As thousands descend on Davos this month for a World Economic Forum meeting that is often billed as the most important in the world, one question is on everyone’s mind: Is Davos right about everything, or is it all just gossip?"," The World Economic Forum is returning to Davos, Switzerland, and while attendees are often left shaking their heads, others are asking whether the annual event has lost its sense of purpose."

There, she was approached by Jonathan Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and co-chairman of the board of Loews Corp."", '""You see how great these events are for the city?"" Tisch asked.Â\xa0""Why don\'t we team up to bring the Grammys back to New York?""', ""Three years later, according to multiple sources close to the Â\xadnegotiations, the Grammys are indeed set to return to New York's Madison Square Garden -- for just the second time in 17 years -- for the show's 60th anniversary in 2018. The deal is all but done, city sources say, and a formal announcement will be made after this year's ceremony. But sources close to the situation tell Billboard thatÂ\xa0after that New York sojourn,Â\xa0theÂ\xa0GrammysÂ\xa0will return to the Staples Center in 2019, as part of a multi-year extension of its most recent agreement.Â\xa0"", 'After all, the Grammys have developed a cozy relationship with their Los Angeles base, particularly the awards-show-friendly Staples Center. While the ceremony Â\xadessentially traded off between L.A. and New York for its first three decades, that ended in the late 1990s after a very public spat between then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Recording Academy chief Michael Greene, which spiraled into threats and insults after Greene refused to allow Hizzoner to read the list of nominees at a news Â\xadconference promoting the awards show. ""If they want to go back to L.A., they can,"" said Giuliani in 1998. ""We could replace the Grammys in about a day.""', ""But by 2014, New York wanted them back. The Grammys bring an estimated $82Â\xa0million bump to its host city's economy, according to a report from the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board; the mayor's office says the total could be as much as $200Â\xa0million in ancillary Â\xadspending. That summer, Tisch Â\xadintroduced GlenÂ\xa0to Recording Academy CEO Neil Portnow. The Grammys' agreement with Staples was up for renewal in 2017, and native New Yorker Portnow was interested."", ""But discussions lay dormant as de Blasio became ensnared in a series of investigations into his fund-raising, which left City Hall reluctant to ask would-be donors for contributions. The calculus changed at the start of 2016, when Julie Menin, a longtime civic activist who worked to revitalize Lower Manhattan in the years after 9/11, was named to head the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment; just as she was appointed, her Â\xaddepartment's purview grew from film and TV to include a number of other creative industries, especially music."", 'In February, Menin flew to L.A. to meet with The Recording Academy. According to sources familiar with the negotiation, the academy balked, mostly because a show in New York would require an additional $6.5Â\xa0million in costs due to increased production, labor and venue expenses.', 'City Hall declined to offer up funds, so Menin set about raising the money from private Â\xadinterests, enlisting Related Companies, a major real estate developer in the city, to invest, along with Spotify, Â\xadconsulting company Accenture and the Partnership for New York City; she also negotiated with labor unions for concessions on costs. Not every union was Â\xadwilling, however, so final costs ended up rising to $8Â\xa0million, Â\xadaccording to a source -- a figure Menin promptly matched by a new round of solicitation.', '""She came to us looking for some help, and we did our best to Â\xadaccommodate,"" says James Claffey, president of Local 1, the stagehands union for MSG. Claffey offered flexibility on call times and meal times that the Grammys sought. ""Honestly, I did not think Julie would pull it off,"" he adds. ""She was remarkable.""', 'The toughest knot of all, however, was the venue and its executive chairman James Dolan. The Grammys require the arena to remain dark for nearly two weeks as the set is built and taken down.', '""It\'s a pain in the ass for them,"" one person involved in the Â\xadnegotiation tells Billboard. ""It\'s a money loser."" Another source says Dolan declined to meet with de Blasio or New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, since the Â\xadlatter two have a long-running feud and Dolan did not want to get involved. But Irving Azoff, Dolan\'s business partner in Azoff-MSG Entertainment, had been in touch with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman -- a neutral party in the feud -- who reassured Dolan and Portnow that the city and state would adhere to whatever was agreed to, says a source. MSG also requested that the Grammys be presented ""in the round,"" which would allow it to sell more luxury suites and help make up the Â\xadfinancial shortfall for the remaining 11 dark days. Why was the venue so Â\xadcooperative? Not Â\xadcoincidentally, Azoff-MSGE also runs the Staples Center\'s fiercest Â\xadcompetitor: The Forum. (Representatives for The Recording Academy, Azoff, MSG, Staples Center owner AEG and City Hall declined requests for comment.)', 'All seemed positive until the eve of a get-to-know-each-other dinner with the stakeholders -- representatives from MSG, Tisch, Claffey, Menin, Portnow, the CEO of the corporate sponsors on the host committee and reps for the academy -- when The New York Times reported the Grammys would be returning to New York. ""It put a bit of a strain on the dinner,"" says one attendee.', 'While reps for the academy and the city declined to comment beyond statements like Menin\'s to Billboard -- ""We\'re having Â\xadproductive Â\xadconversations"" -- and sources close to the academy insist the deal is not final, the Grammys are Â\xadconspicuously doubling down on their presence in New York. In December, the academy purchased a $13.5Â\xa0million Manhattan townhouse to serve as a new local headquarters; on Feb. 7, it announced the Â\xadopening of the first East Coast Grammy Museum at the Prudential Center in nearby Newark, N.J.; and on Jan.Â\xa030, Menin was a featured speaker at a Grammy reception for New York nominees at the Standard Hotel.', 'Even if, as multiple sources confirm,Â\xa0the Grammys are held in New York next year, a longer-term Â\xadarrangement may take more fund-raising and finagling in light of the Academy\'s deal to return to Staples in 2019.

" The President's Budget Director Mick Mulvaney defended budget cuts to Meals on Wheels, saying that it was “just not showing any results.”",,"['Follow Us:', 'Get the Upshot in your Inbox', 'Meals on Wheels has been delivering food to older people in the United States since the 1950s. Last year it served 2.4 million people. This week, after President Trump released his budget proposal, a furor erupted over the program’s future and effectiveness. Let’s look at the evidence.', 'Mr. Trump’s budget proposes big cuts to discretionary spending. In a news conference on Thursday, his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, defended cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program by arguing that it was “just not showing any results.” (Some states give a portion of that block grant money to Meals on Wheels.)', '“We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “And Meals on Wheels sounds great — again, that’s a state decision to fund that particular portion to. But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, ‘Look, we want to give you money for programs that don’t work’ — I can’t defend that anymore.”', 'Despite expressions of alarm on social media, killing the community block grant program would most likely not kill Meals on Wheels. The financial statements from 2015 show that such grants amounted to just under $250,000, or about 3 percent of the total revenue for the program’s national resource center. More than 85 percent came from corporate, foundation and personal donations. Clearly, federal funding for the national program office isn’t the linchpin for its success.', 'Public funds at the local level, however, are more substantial, and Meals on Wheels gets much more funding through a different federal program. The nutrition programs of the Older Americans Act support the Meals on Wheels chapters as they actually operate on the ground, and about 30 percent of the expense of home-delivered meals is covered by federal sources.', 'A cut to this program would have a far more significant effect, especially since that support had been decreasing even before the new budget was considered. The Trump budget calls for a 17.9 percent cut in funding for this program’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and it is quite possible Meals on Wheels could be affected. We won’t know until H.H.S. finalizes its budget.', 'Now, what about the assumption, explicit or implicit, that the program has not achieved “results”?', 'Meals on Wheels has been the subject of many peer-reviewed studies in the medical literature. So many have been done that there are several systematic reviews gathering these studies into various domains.', 'In 2014, researchers explored the evidence on whether home-delivered meal programs improved the diet and nutrition of older Americans. They found eight studies, two of which were randomized controlled trials. Six of the eight showed that programs like Meals on Wheels improve the quality of people’s diet, increase their nutrient intake, and reduce their food insecurity and nutritional risk. They also noted that the programs increased chances for human contact and improved quality of life.', 'A 2015 review found that 80 studies have been conducted on programs like Meals on Wheels. The authors noted, however, that few of these were randomized controlled trials, and that even fewer focused on the program as a whole. They were correct, and I am sympathetic to these calls for more rigorous trials. But such trials are hard to do, they’re expensive, and funding for them seems to be going down, not up.', 'Saying that you want better evidence is different from saying that there is no evidence, though.', 'It’s important to recognize that the program’s benefits are not merely nutritional. A 2016 study showed that participants in the Meals on Wheels program had lower loneliness scores. A 2013 study showed that spending on services like Meals on Wheels was associated with less reliance on institutionalized care, because more people could live independently at home. They may even have fewer falls at home and less worry about being able to remain there.', 'Finally, although no one measures it, Meals on Wheels brings people food they otherwise wouldn’t have.', 'Researchers conducted economic analyses in 2013 and showed that if all states had increased the number of older Americans who had received Meals on Wheels by just 1 percent, the states would have saved Medicaid more than $109 million. Most of those savings would have come from reductions in the need for nursing home care.', 'We can debate the cost-effectiveness of Meals on Wheels, but it would be wrong to say that it’s not effective. There are plenty of results, and I’ve highlighted only some of the most rigorous research available. Most programs we fund through tax dollars have far less evidence to support them, if any evidence at all.', 'About the worst thing you might say about Meals on Wheels is that putting money into a different program might be of more help to older Americans. There’s no evidence that Meals on Wheels is the most cost-effective program there is, or that it’s the most efficient use of our taxpayer dollars.', 'Any argument that goes in that direction, though, raises the question of whether there is a program that does a better job, and whether there is evidence to support it.']"," In the first of a two-part series about the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts, the Washington Post’s Matthew Schofield assesses Meals on Wheels, one of the WhiteHouse budget's biggest targets."," President Trump's proposed budget cuts federal funding for Meals on Wheels, a charity that feeds older people."," In the latest iteration of our series of letters from American journalists, filmmaker and columnist Richard Pérez-G<unk>rcal looks at the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to the Meals on Wheels program.", A look at some of the facts surrounding the proposed cuts to the Meals on Wheels program.," Meals on Wheels, a popular social service project for older Americans, has been the subject of fierce debate in the wake of the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to the agency."," The President's Budget Director Mick Mulvaney defended budget cuts to Meals on Wheels, saying that it was “just not showing any results.”"

The focus shifts to the Foreign Relations Committee on Monday afternoon as the members, including Rubio, cast their votes on Tillerson.', 'Rubio, whom Trump defeated for the GOP presidential nomination last year, clashed with Tillerson at a committee hearing earlier this month. Rubio bridled at his refusal to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” or condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He chided Tillerson over the need for “moral clarity.”', 'But as the committee prepares to vote on Tillerson’s nomination, Rubio faces a dilemma. He must either back down, which means a retreat from a strong stand on Russia and human rights, or cross Trump in the first days of his presidency.', 'A “no” vote from Rubio would not doom Tillerson’s confirmation, because the nomination could go directly to the Senate floor without a positive committee recommendation. But it would be an embarrassing rebuke to Trump just as his presidency gets underway, with questions swirling about his ties to Russia. GOP party activists would be certain to remember Rubio’s defection, although it’s impossible to predict how such a vote might look years from now if Rubio ever runs for president again.', 'Ahead of the vote Rubio was keeping fellow senators and everyone else guessing. After Trump was sworn in on Friday, Rubio was tight-lipped, saying only that he would make his decision “certainly before the vote” and that Tillerson’s responses to written questions had addressed some of his concerns.', 'Neither McCain nor Graham is on the committee, but their support could make it tougher for Rubio to remain a holdout.

The Foreign Relations Committee is narrowly split between 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, so Republicans must all hold together to vote Tillerson out favorably unless he gets some Democratic backing.', 'Tillerson himself, former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, refused to respond to questions about Rubio’s opposition as he traversed the Capitol on Friday after attending Trump’s inauguration. Tillerson has a long record of doing deals in Russia and questioned U.S. sanctions against Russia, which has provoked concerns from Democrats and some Republicans over his selection.', 'Further roiling the debate is U.S. intelligence’s assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.']"," The Washington Post's Jonathan Martin has a preview of Monday's vote over Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson."," As Tillerson moves closer to confirmation, Rubio faces a tricky dilemma: back Tillerson, but don't cross Trump."," In today's edition of the Hill newspaper, a senator faces a choice over a controversial Trump nominee, who could soon become the next secretary of state."," A former Trump rival is poised to vote for his former boss' secretary of state, the Washington Post's Jonathan Allen reports."," As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee prepares to vote on Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, Marco Rubio will decide if his opposition to Tillerson is principled or political.", The Washington Post's Domenico Montanaro looks at the potential consequences for the White House of one of President Trump's most contentious 2016 rivals voting against the president's secretary of state nominee.

I commend all councils for how they are getting on with the job. Public satisfaction with local services has been maintained, and councils are engaged in substantial efforts to modernise, transform local services and reduce waste so that frontline services can be protected.”', 'Javid argued that part of the shift was towards “funding reforms to make councils more self-sufficient”. He said the government had listened to the “unanimous view” that social care must be priorities, and cited an extra £3.5bn funding by 2019/20.', '“Recognising the immediate challenges in the care market facing many councils next year, this settlement repurposes £240m of money which was previously directed to local authorities via the New Homes Bonus to create a new adult social care support grant next year.

 The most popular and talked about podcast since Serial.,,"['Log in or sign up to create your own posts.', ""S-Town's host and executive producer Brian Reed and executive producer Julie Snyder explain to BuzzFeed News how they assembled the most popular, and talked about, podcast since Serial. Warning: MAJOR SPOILERS."", 'Brian Reed, of S-Town.', 'S-Town — the podcast also known by the uncensored title Shittown — has captured listeners’ imaginations, and dominated the iTunes charts, due to its astonishing strengths: the deftness of its prose, the complexity of its pacing, and its humane, clear-eyed treatment of its characters. As assembled into seven chapters by reporter Brian Reed of This American Life and executive producer Julie Snyder of Serial, the show starts out in true-crime territory similar to the first season of Serial: Reed heads to the tiny Alabama town of Woodstock to investigate a possible murder at the behest of one of its residents, John B. McLemore.', ""The podcast, however, ends up exploring far less familiar terrain. (Warning: This story contains MAJOR SPOILERS for anyone who has not finished S-Town.) For one, Reed discovers that the murder he’s investigating never happened. For another, McLemore asserts himself as S-Town’s true subject — an essentially retired antique clock restorer, the 49-year-old emerges as a one-of-a-kind Deep South eccentric with an inexhaustible intellectual curiosity and fits of profane disquisition. As an example, after just a few minutes in his first conversation with Reed, McLemore rattled off the exact GPS coordinates for a hedge maze he created on his property from memory. Later, he said that as a teenager he was into “the astrolabe, sundials, projective geometry, new wave music, climate change, and how to solve Rubik's cubes,” before launching into a rant about “the cool Greenland melt falling directly into the less dense water where the thermohaline convector normally heads back south…”"", ""S-Town really comes into its own at the end of Chapter II, when Reed gets a shocking call from one of McLemore’s friends, informing him that McLemore killed himself two days prior, by ingesting cyanide. For the rest of the podcast, Reed pursues the fallout from McLemore's suicide, and S-Town transforms into an intimate and sprawling portrait of the man, the people who knew him best, and the community that shaped his life — a community that so repulsed McLemore, he gave it the name that Reed then adopted for the title of the podcast. With all seven episodes released at the same time, the result feels like the first podcast that unfolds like a piece of audio literature, with the storytelling care and humane complexity of works of narrative nonfiction like Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood or Jon Krakauer’s Into the Wild. Listening to it is like witnessing the invention of a stirring and sublime work of art."", 'Reed and Snyder spoke with BuzzFeed News about how the show came together, and how they navigated the many burning questions listeners were certain to have after finishing it.', 'After McLemore killed himself on June 22, 2015, Reed was unsure that his reporting in Woodstock would ever amount to a story, let alone a seven-part podcast.', '""I wanted to just go to his funeral,"" Reed said. ""We weren\'t sure what to do. … I was doing many other stories during the time I was talking to John, and [S-Town] was kind of something I would do when I had time, on the side.""', 'At This American Life, Reed explained, roughly half of the stories staffers pursue ultimately get killed, and his journey with McLemore might have gone that direction. ""What happened after he died is that at least two reporting threads presented themselves to us,"" Reed said. ""I legitimately had questions about this man\'s life. There were people who seemed to know him well who weren\'t contacted [after he died]. And then also, the people I did know who were close to him were telling me that there was something nefarious going on in the wake of his suicide, and were keeping in touch with me about it. That seemed like something very clear to report on and document.""', 'Reed estimated that he spoke with ""two or three dozen"" people for over a year after McLemore died, through interviews conducted on the record, on background, and off the record. He is unsure of the precise number of hours of recordings he amassed in total. ""A hundred?"" he said after a long pause. ""More than a hundred? I really don\'t know, honestly! I try not to think about it that way, because it overwhelms my mind.""', 'To make sense of it all, he and Snyder created a massive spreadsheet that organized all the interviews and what was said in them before they started piecing together the structure for the show. And that’s when they began to understand that S-Town wasn’t anything like a typical radio story. ""There isn\'t a totally clear question that [Reed] set out with at the beginning, which is generally how I would say 98% of This American Life stories are structured,"" said Snyder.', 'Without a central question, they knew the podcast would have to be, at least in part, a profile of McLemore — a format Snyder called ""really anathema to radio"" due to its lack of a strong forward-motion narrative. ""For those reasons, I felt like it\'s important for it to feel that Brian has a story to bring you, and you\'re going to have to trust that he knows the beginning, the middle, and the end of this story,"" she said. ""I felt like that\'s what you get when you read a novel. You open the first page, you have no idea where you are and why you\'re there, but you have a confidence that you know you can physically see there\'s a final page, and the author has a story to tell you.""', 'Julie Snyder and Brian Reed', 'Reed added that the very nature of his reporting — especially ""the metaphors that John was handing me"" in their interviews — leant itself to a literary approach. ""He\'s a horologist,"" he said. ""He\'s got a giant maze in his backyard with 64 different solutions and one with no way out. \'Shittown\' as a concept even seems literary — the very multifaceted way in which he employed that word. And it seemed to encapsulate not only his town but much larger ideas about the failures in society, statewide, nationally, globally.""', 'The sheer length of time Reed took to report the story even ended up contributing to the podcast\'s novelistic appeal. ""We realized when we sat down to structure it that I\'d accidentally given myself the power of omniscience, in a way, and of foreshadowing,"" said Reed. ""We\'d be talking about a scene that happened a year and a half ago, that we\'re putting in the story, and I knew something from the future about that person, or that scene. People have literally died and been born in the time that I\'ve been around the people in Woodstock.""', ""The style of S-Town also sets the podcast apart as a piece of journalism: Many of the concrete questions Reed explored — like the location of McLemore's purported stash of gold, or the reason behind why many of McLemore's friends didn’t learn about his death until after his funeral — remain unresolved by the show's end."", '""I mean, I wanted to answer them, and I did my best in reporting them, and presented my best findings,"" said Reed.', 'Snyder also stressed that S-Town relied on time-honored best practices of journalism — checking and rechecking facts, tracking down interviews, finding documentation, etc. — even if that wasn\'t always apparent in the way they presented Reed\'s reporting, given the conversational tone of the show. ""The idea is that maybe the reporting is kind of a little easy-breezy also,"" she said, causing Reed to laugh. ""What makes up the story is really very traditional, unglamorous, kind of sloggy reporting.""', '(One thing they didn’t stress: getting photos of McLemore or anyone else from S-Town for the podcast\'s website, which has almost no photos at all. ""I hate pictures,"" Snyder said with a laugh. ""I\'m highly opposed to pictures with radio stories. I don\'t know if I\'ll always think that\'s true, but 93% of the time, I will always say no pictures. That\'s what the internet\'s for."")', 'Ultimately, however, the more traditional journalism that propels This American Life and Serial, driven by seeking conclusive answers to explicit questions, just didn\'t apply to S-Town — and that was fine with its makers. ""For Julie and me, those aren\'t the things that interest us most about the story,"" said Reed. ""When we\'re making a story, for a large part we\'re making it for ourselves and our own taste. And in that regard, it would have been cool to be able to report some of that stuff out further than I did. But it wasn\'t terribly upsetting to us.""', ""S-Town’s final chapter includes a moment from early on in Reed's reporting when he spoke with McLemore's quasi-surrogate son Tyler Goodson, another of the story’s central characters. His life was upended the most by McLemore's death, in part due to his efforts to collect items from McLemore’s property that he claimed were his. Due to the legal dispute over who owned the land and everything on it, Reed counseled Goodson about revealing on the record whether he'd found the cache of gold McLemore hinted he’d hidden on his property."", '""Well, listen, I clearly want to know if you ever do find it. But you should think about it before you tell me, if you ever do, because it\'s then going to be public,"" Reed tells Goodson on the show.', '""Yeah, I know. That\'s what I\'m scared of now,"" Goodson replies.', '""I would worry if you found a million dollars in gold, or if you found, like, a bunch of gold,"" says Reed. ""Just consider it before you ever tell me, all right?""', 'After a pause, Goodson asks Reed to turn off his recorder, and Reed, in voiceover, explains that they\'d had ""a discussion off the record.""', 'Brian Reed recording an interview for S-Town with an unnamed subject (though not John McLemore).', 'That is the last we hear about McLemore\'s gold on S-Town — and that\'s where Reed wants to leave it, at least for now. ""I\'ve really said as much as I feel comfortable saying in the show itself,"" he said.', 'Reed also pushed back at the suggestion that placing that conversation at the end of the show might leave listeners with the impression that Goodson did, indeed, find at least some gold. ""Actually, I think if you look online, people are having all sorts of conclusions,"" said Reed. ""That was not our intention.""', 'Reed and Snyder said they only meant to give listeners the most up-to-date information they had on the record about Goodson\'s legal situation (which, by the way, has not changed since the show went live — he’s is still awaiting trial on several charges). ""Also, people in the story speculate that Tyler took the gold, so we did have a responsibility to run the question past him,"" Snyder said.', ""One theory on the whereabouts of McLemore's gold is that the Woodstock police could have either made off with it themselves or looked the other way when someone else did. Conspicuously, however, Reed said no police officers would speak with him despite multiple requests for an interview. All he got were written responses to some questions he sent to the town's chief of police, which included the department's denial that they had found any gold on McLemore's property (as Reed noted in Chapter V)."", 'Another voice largely absent from S-Town is McLemore\'s mother, Mary Grace, whose well-being becomes the first spark of conflict between Goodson and her next of kin, McLemore’s cousin Rita and her husband Charlie. But Reed said he did get a chance to interview Mary Grace on the record after Rita and Charlie brought him to see her. ""I saw where she was staying, and she did seem to be doing well,"" he said. ""She was in pretty good spirits. She\'s very quick-witted, despite her clear dementia, and funny, and kind of biting sometimes.""', 'Reed ultimately chose not to use any of his recorded interviews with Mary Grace in the podcast. ""It didn\'t seem to fit into the story,"" he said, choosing his words carefully. ""It wasn\'t the most…her faculties are not there in terms of an interview."" He did, however, use some of what he learned from Mary Grace. ""For instance, the detail I include in the last [chapter] about her rubbing her stomach and praying for a genius,"" he said. ""I had heard that story from someone else she had told it to, but then she told me that multiple times on the record."" As far as Reed knows, Mary Grace is still staying with family friends. ""The last I heard in the last couple months, she\'s been thriving and doing well.""', 'McLemore kept a small army of stray dogs on his sprawling property, and there was some question as to what would become of them — McLemore had requested that they be euthanized after he killed himself. It turns out, they\'re almost certainly fine. ""For a long time, at least two of them were with Tyler,"" said Reed. ""And then it\'s my understanding that homes were found for the rest. I don\'t have the firmest information on this, but to my knowledge, they were not euthanized.""', 'Although S-Town has earned wide critical acclaim, responses to the podcast have not been uniformly positive. A recent Vox essay with the headline ""S-Town is a stunning podcast. It probably shouldn\'t have been made."" typifies a lot of the criticism of the show — namely, that Reed went too far in exploring the intimate details of McLemore\'s romantic and sexual history with other men without McLemore\'s expressed consent to do so.', 'It is an argument that frustrates Reed and Snyder. They both note that McLemore outed himself in his second email to This American Life, and was always up front about his sexuality with Reed when he was alive. ""I didn\'t ask him about that, I was asking about a murder. He put it on the table,"" Reed said.', 'Reed and Snyder decided that discussing McLemore’s sexuality was necessary to paint a full portrait of the man and his community. ""In terms of the very particular experience of a gay man in his forties who grew up in Alabama in Bibb County, it\'s unique,"" said Snyder. ""I thought it would be very odd to talk about John and not talk about his experience with love. … I think it\'s meaningful for a lot of people who had that experience.""', ""Snyder suggested that uneasiness with exploring McLemore's sexuality could have something to do with society’s larger issues with intimacy between two men. She cited a passage in Chapter VI featuring Olin Long, a close confidant of McLemore's who wrestled with his desire for something beyond friendship between them. Long reached out to Reed specifically to speak on the record about McLemore; he shared an anecdote about sitting in McLemore's pickup truck with him and experiencing a surge of deep feeling for his friend."", 'Long tells Reed on the podcast, ""I wanted to reach over there, I wanted to pull his shirt up, expose his belly, and just kiss all over his belly around that red hair, just to that extent. And I wanted to do it slowly and sensuously. That\'s what I wanted to do, and see what he thought about it.""', '""It\'s incredibly intimate, when Olin talks about what could have been,” Snyder said. “Brian knows, I would squirm [listening to it]. I would be totally like, \'Oh god, where\'s he going?\'"" She compared it to her reaction to watching the beach scene in the film Moonlight during which two teenage boys have a sexual encounter. ""I totally squirmed then, too. I think there\'s a bit of homophobia in squirming at that intimacy. I recognized it in myself when I saw Moonlight, and I recognized it in Olin\'s talking about John.""', 'S-Town also explores another complex form of intimacy, which McLemore shared with Goodson, a straight man in his mid-twenties, in a ritual the two men referred to as ""church"": Goodson would run a tattoo gun over McLemore’s body, over and over again, often without any ink, to inflict a kind of targeted pain. The Vox piece criticized Reed for not correctly characterizing ""church"" as the BDSM practice of ""needle play,"" something Reed takes strong issue with.', '""I could never do that because that\'s not how Tyler characterizes it,"" Reed said. ""That would be me imposing a thing onto the person who actually partook in it. I\'m open to the idea that these are complicated activities that can mean many things at once. But the way that it was described to me by Tyler is that it helped [McLemore] relieve his pain. It helped him be able to sleep at night. It cleared his mind of his worries, which is similar to cutting, and we checked with a social worker, and they agreed.""', 'Reed felt that he was justified in including these details about ""church"" because they involved Goodson just as much as they involved McLemore. ""Tyler talked to me about it many times. It was something he was dealing with in the wake of John\'s death."" He’d heard multiple people in Woodstock say that Goodson was a bad influence on McLemore, but Goodson said McLemore was the one pleading with him to do ""church"" every night, Reed said. ""I thought it helped give a much fuller and more complicated picture of their relationship at the end. We were very judicious about what we did include. There was much more that we did not. ... We tried to treat it with as much care as possible.""', 'According to Reed, McLemore never really expressed much of a political opinion beyond his low opinion of politics in general. ""He thinks of the Democratic and Republican parties as twin cheeks on the same ass,"" Reed said. ""But we didn\'t delve much deeper than that.""', ""McLemore died a week after Donald Trump formally announced that he was running for president in 2015; as the rest of the media world scrambled to understand Trump voters the next year, Reed and Snyder had their heads down putting S-Town together. They said they didn't really think about the fact that their show was set among exactly the kind of working-class white voters who made up a big part of Trump's base."", ""However, Reed did have to personally confront at least one issue wrapped up with some of those supporters: Reed’s wife is black, and many of the people he spoke to for S-Town, including McLemore, held racist attitudes and used racist terms. At a certain point in his reporting, his spouse's race became much harder to keep private."", 'Brian Reed', '""With Tyler and his family, I was just spending so much time with them that, like, eventually they wanted to be friends on Facebook,"" he said. ""We talked about the use of certain words. And I told him that they made me uncomfortable. It\'s a weird position to be in as a journalist, because you don\'t want people to censor themselves. So that\'s not what I was trying to do. But I was also trying to be myself, you know? But [Goodson] was fine. Like, it was not an issue. And some of the language did calm down after that, actually.""', 'And then, well into the editing process for S-Town, Trump was elected president. At first, Reed was plunged into despair. ""The day after the election, I remember coming in and feeling like, What the hell\'s the point of this story?"" Reed said. ""There\'s all this stuff going on in the world to cover. I want to be back at my normal job where I can do reporting about things that are actually happening now, that are relevant to the world. And then the next day, I remember feeling like, Oh, maybe this is a little bit what the story\'s about.""', 'After some discussion, S-Town’s connection to the Trump voter didn\'t really end up changing their approach to the podcast. ""I think we just kind of comforted ourselves with that thought,"" he said, laughing with Snyder. ""It was a way to feel OK about why we weren\'t reporting on the incoming administration and the very surprising election.""', 'S-Town’s popularity has already elicited inquiries about possible movie or TV adaptations. ""There\'s definitely been interest,"" said Snyder. ""I\'m very literal, so I have a hard time being like, What would it be, other than just people speaking the lines of the podcast? But it would be cool to see.""', 'Given S-Town’s reception, one might expect Reed, Snyder, and the This American Life and Serial teams to be talking seriously about how to make another podcast that attempts the same narrative style again.', '""We\'re so bad at that,"" said Snyder. ""No. I know, I know. It sounds like I\'m being paternalistic when I\'m like, ‘No, trust me, you like us better this way.’ If we thought that way, we would have come out of the first season of Serial and looked for another murder story. If anything, we actively move against it.""', '""I think part of what makes the thing feel new, and what made Serial feel new, and what makes anything feel new, is that the creators are trying to fend off their own boredom,” added Reed. “So to try to recreate this — I don\'t know.""', '""I told you that my brother wants us to do Shittown Season 2 in my hometown?"" Snyder said to Reed with a laugh. ""That\'s what we joked about, the anthology series of Shittown. We\'ll just do Shittowns across America.""', 'BuzzFeed Home © 2017 BuzzFeed, Inc.']"," S-Town, a critically-acclaimed new podcast by This American Life and This Week in Radio producer Brian Reed, has been described by the Guardian as 'Serial meets Inside Out', as the Washington Post has called it."," BBC News: ""'S-Town' - the best-selling, best-plotted, most addictive podcast since Serial."""," In the wake of the success of Serial, a new podcast has taken the internet by storm.... and not just the fact that it has become one of the most downloaded shows on iTunes."," After the success of the podcast Serial and the hit show Serial's spin-off S-Town, what's it like making a new podcast that's as strong as Serial but with a much smaller cast and much less story?"," BuzzFeed's Dan Roberts and Eric Deggans review this month's launch of the new podcast S-Town, which is the first of three it intends to produce with This American Life reporter Brian Reed.", The most popular and talked about podcast since Serial.

The majority of Courage the Cowardly Dog. But the scariest episode to me is when Eustace steals the Egyptian slab.

Dolls that move on their own always freaked me out and Gooey Gus’ melting face was terrifying.” —Sarah Cohen, Facebook', '4. When Nosferatu flicks the lights on and off on SpongeBob SquarePants.', '“Definitely the ‘Graveyard Shift’ episode of SpongeBob.

When the Fright Hound walks out of the fire in Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated.', '“The episode, ‘Howl of the Fright Hound,’ absolutely scarred my brother and I for LIFE. Brief synopsis: The town thinks that Scooby has turned and is attacking people, but it’s actually a mechanical clone of him (think a dog Terminator) and they have to stop the machine before he kills everyone. In the climax of the episode, Scooby and Shaggy are running through a warehouse being chased by the robot dog when a fire starts and they think its killed him……but NOPE. They show the skin burning off of the robot and then out walks THIS BEAST OF PURE EVIL FROM THE FIRES OF HELL. THE SOURCE OF MY NIGHTMARES AND REASON I NEVER BOUGHT MECHANICAL DOG TOYS. I still can’t watch it to this day…and this picture terrifies me. The red eyes, the razor sharp teeth (that killed people) and the firey hell background. I hate this show.” —skailyr', '15. When Grandpa showed up as a zombie in Arnold’s dream in Hey Arnold!', '“That episode of Hey Arnold! where Arnold and Gerald stop being friends!
