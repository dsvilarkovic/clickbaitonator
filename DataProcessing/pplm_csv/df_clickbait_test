Security Council called to review what the Trump administration calls its most dire national security concern. “The more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it.”', 'Tillerson’s push at a special session of the Security Council came as the Trump administration said it is willing to bargain directly with North Korea over ending its nuclear weapons program, but under strict conditions that make talks unlikely anytime soon.', 'Ahead of the diplomatic effort at the United Nations, President Trump said direct conflict is possible. “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an interview this week. “We’d love to solve things diplomatically, but it’s very difficult.”', 'Hours after the U.N. meeting, North Korea fired another missile early Saturday local time, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Cmdr.

" Goldman Sachs' first-quarter results were better than expected, but the results were overshadowed by one trader's loss on a bet on Peabody Energy.",,"['Adam Savarese was looking to make a splash in his new job as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s top distressed-debt trader last year, and found it in Peabody Energy Corp.', 'The coal miner was hurtling toward bankruptcy. Savarese snagged its unsecured bonds for pennies on the dollar and rode them up for one of 2016’s most successful trades, according to people familiar with the desk and its wagers. It was risky: Some peers at other banks played it safer with secured bonds, which offered greater protection, though a smaller upside.\xa0But Savarese’s blockbuster Peabody move helped engineer a rebound on a desk\xa0buffeted by losses and the departure of senior leaders.', 'Now that same rescue play is inflicting pain. Though the trade is still a winner over its lifetime, it reversed course in the first quarter to contribute to a fixed-income trading performance at Goldman Sachs that was so unexpectedly soft that the stock tumbled as much as 5.8 percent on April 18. While currencies and commodities trading left an even bigger dent, the performance by Savarese -- and the bank’s entire credit desk -- has attracted attention because it contrasts with better results at rivals.', 'Savarese’s is a familiar tale in the business, where you can be riding high one minute and humbled the next.\xa0If the 39-year-old sold or reduced his holding in December, he could’ve locked in gains. Instead, the bank’s position in Peabody declined about $40 million this year, a person with knowledge of the matter said.', 'But Goldman Sachs has demonstrated an ability to stomach trades that work brilliantly and then, suddenly, don’t, showing how it still embraces a volatility in trading operations that’s out of favor on much of Wall Street. In the first quarter, gains on other positions helped compensate for the Peabody losses. In the end, the distressed desk was more profitable than during the same period last year, according to Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman.', 'Still, the bank’s total fixed-income trading revenue rose just 1 percent from a year earlier to $1.69 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates by about $340 million as rivals outpaced forecasts.', '“If those losses sustain for a long period and aren’t addressed, then you’ve got yourself a problem,”\xa0said\xa0Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS Group AG, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. “Investors were generally willing to give Goldman a pass on the first-quarter weakness, but if we see that translate into second-quarter or third-quarter weakness, then I think people will start to ask themselves far more fundamental questions.”', 'Read more: Goldman said to get burned by coal, retail in trading miss', 'Because Savarese did so well last year, the first-quarter miss may be viewed as just a blip,\xa0according to a person with knowledge of the internal politics.

Financial institutions must prove their bond inventory is used to meet client demands, which may mean holding positions for long periods.\xa0A person familiar with the bank’s policies said the trades were within the rule’s bounds.', 'DuVally, the spokesman, declined to comment on the Volcker Rule, but said that according to internal estimates, the bank was a market maker on about one-quarter of the Peabody Energy bonds traded in 2016.

After he departed Morgan Stanley for Goldman Sachs in late 2015, the buzz among his new colleagues -- and rivals -- was all about the fate of the distressed book he left behind, according to people who have worked or traded with him.

Savarese left just months before Gorman fired 25 percent of fixed-income traders and salespeople.', 'He landed at Goldman Sachs, where his older brother Jason is co-chief operating officer of the securities division, which houses the trading units, including the distressed-debt desk. Adam joined as a partner, one of the few people the bank has hired from a competitor at that level.', 'At the time, Goldman Sachs’s distressed-debt desk was in turmoil. Jerry Keefe and Dennis Lafferty, who had been co-heads of the group with Tom Tormey, both left after Tormey was elevated to partner. Keefe joined hedge fund CarVal Investors and Lafferty departed for HSBC Holdings Plc. Some time later, Tormey moved into a different role and handed oversight to Savarese.', 'In 2016, spurred by the Peabody bet, as well as a position in Ultra Petroleum Corp., his team brought in more than $200 million in revenue, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

" The BBC's movie reviewers offer their top five movies of the summer, below.)",,"['The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.', 'At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.', 'Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.', 'Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.', 'The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.', 'The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.', 'Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.', 'Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.', 'In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.', 'Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”', 'That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.', 'As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.', 'Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.', 'If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.', 'Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.', 'One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.', 'There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I.']", The Washington Post’s Christy Lemire looks at the big superhero films in the works this summer. and and and and and and and," As 2016 draws to a close, we’re taking a look back at the year’s most read film articles and film festival reviews from across the Web."," In the latest round of our series of movie reviews, the editors at Variety offer their take on the year's latest big- screen superhero adventure."," A look at some of the film reviews for the summer blockbuster movies, which range from the low-budget to the big-budget."," As the summer cinematic season kicksoff with a preview of'Guardians of the Galaxy,' what will moviegoers be watching for this year?"," The BBC's movie reviewers offer their top five movies of the summer, below.)"

The French, on the other hand, enjoy nothing less than a high-minded, lofty debate over abstract concepts – or so it is believed. The British ask: “It works in theory, but does it work in practice?” The French ask: “It works in practice, but does it work in theory?” So the joke goes.', 'As a London-based French citizen watching my own country heading for a rancourous presidential runoff on 7 May and Britain preparing for its first post-Brexit general election, I’m not sure the supposed differences between us are as marked as we like to think. And I see lessons for the UK from what is happening across the Channel.', 'While you struggle to make sense of Brexit, we’re struggling with the looming catastrophe that would be the election of Marine Le Pen. And up against her in the second round, the 39-year-old centrist reformer, Emmanuel Macron, is our new national sensation. He wants to abolish the once watertight left-right divide, upending decades of ideological confrontation.', 'He’s no Robespierre. He quoted Albert Camus in one of his rallies earlier this month: “Each generation no doubt believes it is doomed to remake the world. The task of our generation may be even larger: it consists in preventing the world from coming undone.” So, not entirely unBritish.', 'This is not a perfect parallel. Though withdrawal from the EU is sad and costly, it’s unlikely to unravel British democracy. By contrast, the victory of a far-right leader in France would be the death of all the values the republic is meant to uphold. Brexit may be troublesome for EU citizens living in the UK – and there have even been several xenophobic attacks since 23 June – but a Le Pen win would put 7 million or so French nationals of African, Arabic or Muslim descent under constant physical threat. The bigotry that pervades her rallies would be unleashed nationwide. The country’s fragile social fabric, which terrorism has already torn at, would be ripped apart entirely.', 'If the polls are right, Macron should win. He hasn’t yet. But if his rise has proved something the British might do well to heed, it is that a robust political centre does have a chance against rightwing populism. The centre is not ineffective, and it’s not outdated. The old structures may crumble – and indeed the traditional postwar parties in France are all but wiped out – but that does not mean the extreme parts of the political spectrum will be the only ones to grow out of the ruins.', 'Radical rightwing politics has thrived by exploiting the popular rage that characterises the mood in France today (fuelled by joblessness and deep distrust of the elites). Nearly 50% of the electorate voted on 23 April for either the far left, the far right, or Trotskyist and maverick candidates. But so far, even against that sorry backdrop, a clearsighted, energetic Macron has come out on top.', 'He calls himself “progressive”, and stands for social liberalism, or pro-market social democracy. He’s not anti-capitalist nor anti-globalisation, and certainly not nativist. He’s the anti-radical who advocates step-by-step, moderate reform to heal the many fractures of an extremely tense and anxious country. He doesn’t want to pitch social classes or ethnic groups against one another. His is a slow-motion revolution, and that’s something utterly new by French standards. Indeed, he’s more interested in what works in practice than in what might look good in theory. That may seem familiar to you Brits.', 'It’s an approach that could strike a chord across a continent that sees nationalism reawakened, along with its ghosts. Le Pen embodies that rising nationalism in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, the Jarosław Kascyński crowd in Poland. Brexit can be interpreted as a kind of nationalist resurgence. Witness Theresa May’s observation this week that 27 European countries are “lining up against” Britain. How often has a siege mentality tactic been deployed by illiberal politicians to galvanise the populists, with no regard for the consequences?', 'Macron’s ascendency could encourage those in Britain who would like to see another path open up. One that would help counter the kind of narrative deployed by May; one that could soften Brexit. A left-leaning Labour offers little solace in that regard. The best antidote seems to be a confident centre, one built on pragmatic, moral, optimistic beliefs, and, as we see in France, rich in potential. If Macron prevails on 7 May, the immediate effect of his centre revolution will probably be felt in France.

He also tossed 30 touchdowns against six interceptions. While those numbers aren't shabby, the reason why this junior standout has a shot at coming off the board first is his polish. There isn't much tape on the Ohio native, but he's shown the ability to make every throw and has a natural feel for the game. Trubisky's instincts are on point and he has what it takes to develop into a great quarterback at the professional level."", 'With signal-callers generally being hit-or-miss in the draft, even in the early rounds, Trubisky is the safest option at the position in 2017. That alone makes him more attractive to an organization like the Browns, which will have to shell out approximately $30.3 million with over $20 million as a signing bonus if they take the UNC product at No. 1.', ' North Carolina quarterback Mitch Trubisky (10) runs the ball during the first quarter of an NCAA college football game against Illinois, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016 at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Ill.

If Trubisky ends up being the pick and pans out, that $30.3M million will be a great value for a player who could generate hype around a young team, subsequently putting fans in the seats and making merchandise fly off the shelf.', ""However, there are other intriguing options for Cleveland, including star defender Myles Garrett, and there is a decent chance the team goes in that direction. If that is the case, Trubisky stands to lose millions. Oddsmakers currently have the over/under on Trubisky's draft position set at 9.5, with a 68.5% chance of him being selected from No. 1 to No. 9 and 31.5% odds that he is picked at No. 10 or beyond. Should he fall to the Buffalo Bills at No. 10 a realistic landing spot Trubisky's deal would be valued at $16.4M, nearly $14 million less than he could make in Cleveland."", ""The latest Trubisky realistically comes off the board is No. 12, where the Browns own a second first-rounder by way of the Philadelphia Eagles. In an ideal world for Cleveland, the front office would be able to hedge the risk of selecting Trubisky by nabbing him at this draft slot. In this scenario, the team could take a much surer prospect at No. 1 such as Garrett and give him the big payday that comes with that honor. The Tar Heels QB would still be on the roster for the 2017 campaign, but at a vastly reduced price tag. The No. 12 draft pick this year will earn approximately $13.8M, with an $8.2 signing bonus making up the majority of that deal. That has to be a much more palatable situation for the team, especially considering Trubisky's lack of experience."", ' Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is seen before a drill at the 2017 NFL football scouting combine Sunday, March 5, 2017, in Indianapolis.

A minute of tape will tell you that this guy has all the skills of an NFL superstar, as well as a humble attitude and willingness to improve that franchises covet. While Garrett won't impact the game as much as a superstar quarterback could, the odds of him paying dividends on a $30+ million rookie contract are much higher than Trubisky."", ""Regardless of what happens on Thursday night, Trubisky, Garrett and the rest of the first-rounders are poised to become quite rich.

He also got sent home from the combine for his behavior at the hospital during a medical exam.', '20. Takkarist McKinley, DE, UCLA, 6-2, 250 (4.59)', 'He has overcome a lot in his life to be an elite edge-rushing prospect with a bright NFL future. He had 10 sacks last season with plenty of attention from opposing offenses, and he gets off blocks better than most in a draft class loaded with pass-rushers.', '21. Garett Bolles, T, Utah, 6-5, 297 (4.95)', 'Bolles says he overcame his own behavior as a youngster, which could have prevented him from reaching this moment.

Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan, 6-5⅝, 277 (4.92)', ""Some guys tested better, had better stats and showed more consistency than Charlton.

Tre'Davious White, CB, LSU, 5-11¼, 192 (4.47)"", ""White has played outside and in the slot for the Tigers, so NFL talent evaluators have gotten a good look at what he can do.

Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama, 6-0¼, 197 (4.41)', 'Humphrey has all the physical attributes, plays with toughness, and is able to recover from mistakes. He can be challenged deep, however, and he needs to work on that.', '25. John Ross, WR, Washington, 5-10⅜, 188 (4.22)', 'It would be a mistake to say Ross put himself on the radar by setting a combine record in the 40-yard dash. He was already a highly productive receiver with pro potential and only confirmed his elite speed in Indianapolis (even after ACL surgery in 2015 and a torn meniscus in 2014). He will step in as a downfield playmaker and returner.', '26. Charles Harris, LB, Missouri, 6-2¾, 253 (4.82)', ""He has work to do on his overall game but should provide impact in the pass rush out of the gate.

Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson, 6-2½, 221 (4.67)', ""Quarterbacks will be selected long before this slot, but Watson's performance on the biggest stage makes him the best of this year's prospects.

Jarrad Davis, LB, Florida, 6-1, 238 (4.62)', ""Davis was productive on special teams before he became a defensive starter -- that's the start of an NFL résumé. He's a quality tackler who rarely takes false steps after the snap. He has been lauded for his leadership and work ethic."", '30. Kevin King, CB, Washington, 6-3, 200 (4.43)', ""He's the tallest of the top-tier cornerback prospects on the board, so some might see him as a hybrid cornerback/free safety. There are some bobbles in his technique, but the bottom line is that he rarely surrenders touchdowns and plays the ball in the air better than many receivers."", '31. Quincy Wilson, CB, Florida, 6-1½, 211 (4.54)', ""He plays with the confidence of a pro, doesn't shy away from challenges, and rebounds from mistakes. That's a pro corner in waiting.

Budda Baker, S, Washington, 5-9⅝, 195 (4.45)', 'Baker was a state high school sprint champ before he came to the Huskies, and his coverage skills make him a popular prospect.

Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State, 5-10⅜, 210 (4.49)', 'Cook will almost certainly be selected before this slot and is among the best in a loaded running back class.

Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt, 6-3½, 234 (4.67)', ""In a talent-laden conference, Cunningham was the one guy opponents had to contain on the Commodores' defense.

Tyus Bowser, LB, Houston, 6-2⅝, 247 (4.65)', 'He missed part of his final season because of a fractured bone in his face, which he suffered in a fight with a teammate.

Cam Robinson, T, Alabama, 6-6¼, 322 (5.15)', ""Opinions are split on Robinson as a prospect, especially in terms of his footwork against the best speed rushers he has faced. A three-year starter, he will probably be selected long before this spot since it's a thin year for tackles, a position for which there is great demand."", '42. Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina, 6-2⅛, 222 (4.67)', ""He will almost certainly be a first-round pick, and many teams believe he will go in the upper third of the opening round. He has big-time potential but started only one season for the Tar Heels and will need more time to develop than he's likely to be afforded.

JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, USC, 6-1⅜, 215 (4.54)', ""He has had injuries (back, hand) but has shown polish in his routes. He battles for the ball and wins in traffic. He's also a high-character player.

Zay Jones, WR, East Carolina, 6-2⅛, 201 (4.45)', 'His father, Robert, earned three Super Bowl rings with the Dallas Cowboys. Zay had an astounding 399 catches in his career, including a record 158 receptions last season. He was also a kick returner early in his career. He will have to show he can beat man coverage as a pro, something he rarely saw in college.', '46. Gerald Everett, TE, South Alabama, 6-3, 239 (4.62)', ""He played just one season of prep football. There's no reason to believe he won't have an impact quickly in the NFL given his athleticism, but the game video shows his routes need work.

Jordan Willis, DE, Kansas State, 6-3¾, 255 (4.53)', ""He was the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year last season and led the conference with 11.5 sacks.

Chris Wormley, DE/DT, Michigan, 6-5, 298 (4.86)', 'A three-year starter at Michigan with tons of athleticism, Wormley will be a popular name on the second day of the draft.

Dan Feeney, G, Indiana, 6-3⅞, 305 (5.24)', 'He played right guard most of the time for the Hoosiers, though he did perform well at right tackle when he played there because of injuries to other players.

Tim Williams, DE/OLB, Alabama, 6-2⅞, 244 (4.69)', 'Williams will probably get drafted before this slot, but his off-the-field résumé, including an arrest on a misdemeanor gun charge and a reported failed drug test, is cause for concern.

Taylor Moton, G/T, Western Michigan, 6-5, 319 (5.18)', 'A four-year starter, 52 games in all, Moton played three seasons at right tackle, including in 2016, and a season at right guard.

Cordrea Tankersley, CB, Clemson, 6-1¼, 199 (4.40)', ""It tells you how deep the draft is at defensive back when a player with Tankersley's size and speed is considered a second-day player by most teams.

Dion Dawkins, G, Temple, 6-3⅞, 314 (5.11)', 'He lined up at tackle for the Owls, and while he shows some skill as a future right tackle, his first NFL look should come as a guard.

Desmond King, CB/S, Iowa, 5-10, 201 (4.56)', 'He won the Jim Thorpe Award as a junior and still went back and played his senior season for the Hawkeyes.

Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared?', 'Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing “the Wall,” no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and his Supreme Court appointment. “Hitting it out of the ballpark,” said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts.', 'Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. “When I get up in the morning, I think, ‘Well, what did Trump do now?’” said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office.', 'And then there are those somewhere in between.

Still, Mr. Exner was hard pressed to name more than a few accomplishments. He said the airstrike Mr. Trump ordered on Syria resounded as a declaration of American strength.', '“We’ve been on the back burner, defensively, since Obama took office,” he said. “The first thing I said to my wife when I heard about Syria was, ‘Syria isn’t really the target. He’s put the world on notice — we’re back.’” — Julie Bosman', 'Back in January, Maureen Sauer had to be coaxed into traveling to the Women’s March on Washington from her home in O’Fallon, Ill.

So it was unsurprising that close to 100 days in, Mr. Maynard had nothing bad to say about Mr. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip talk and style, which has been such a departure from previous presidents.', 'In fact, Mr. Maynard, who hails from tiny Genoa, W.Va., could not think of a single criticism of Mr. Trump’s tenure thus far. He liked Mr. Trump’s attack on President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. And he said his optimism is widely shared in his district, set in the struggling heart of Appalachia and coal country.', '“You know, everybody that I talk to has a positive rating, and they like what he’s doing,” he said. “I’ve not heard any complaints — and that’s my feelings, too.”', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Maynard, a climate change skeptic, praised Mr. Trump for his executive order in March that will undo the Clean Power Plan in an effort to lift the coal industry.', 'Even Mr. Trump’s failures — the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the travel ban blocked by a federal judge — seemed reassuring to Mr. Maynard because they showed that Mr. Trump was trying to do what he had promised.', '“I think attempting is better than doing nothing, whether you’re successful or not,” he said. — Richard Fausset', 'At a rally in Ambridge, Pa., a once-thriving steel and energy town and a symbol of the losses and grievances that powered Mr. Trump to the White House, Ron Ritz waited in line for hours to see the candidate.

Near his small hometown, Friedens, Pa., there was a shuttered coal mine, which he said started up again after Mr. Trump took office. “Guys that were laid off are going back to work,” he said. For him, the best moment of the presidency so far was when Mr. Trump visited coal miners in West Virginia. “I know what those people feel like,” he said. “There was a time in my life I was almost swept under.

She said the other day that she did not declare her support for him until Nov. 8, Election Day, when she cast her ballot. But she ended up attending his inauguration in Washington, and today she defends many of his stumbles as the learning curve of a nonpolitician, one who is keeping his word to shake up government.', 'Ms. Whisenand, 52, an insurance executive in Des Moines, cites the president’s ability to brush off critics in the news media as a sign of success. “He is not making decisions based on polling or what the media is saying,” she said. “I like that about him.” But, she added, “I wish to God he had never tweeted about Obama wiretapping him.” The attempts by Trump allies in the White House and Congress to try to prove Mr. Trump right “looked like the Keystone Kops,” she added. — Trip Gabriel', 'Joe Vigue, 68, came to Mr. Trump reluctantly. As he watched election-night returns stream in at a hotel ballroom in Concord, N.H., a retired construction worker in bluejeans amid a sea of suits, Mr. Vigue ticked off a list of concerns about the military and Mr. Trump’s disparaging comments about Senator John McCain of Arizona.', 'Now, Mr. Vigue, a Vietnam veteran, is pretty happy with what he sees, especially on the issue most important to him: beefing up the military. Mr. Trump has proposed slashing billions from various domestic programs and shifting $54 billion to the armed forces.', 'And he applauded Mr. Trump’s determination to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, reduce wait times for veterans seeking health care and protect their benefits. He still winces once in a while when Mr. Trump “opens his mouth,” but he said the country was much better off than it had been during the previous eight years.', 'To his relief, Mr. Vigue has found Mr. Trump to be “not quite as conservative as a lot of people thought.” Back in November, he said he did not want Mr. Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and as it happens, Mr. Trump failed to do so when he tried.', '“So far, I’m glad I voted for him,” Mr. Vigue said. “I wasn’t so sure for a while, but now I am.” — Katharine Q.

While he remains pleased with Mr. Trump, he has come to understand that the campaign promise to “drain the swamp” is not easily accomplished.', '“The sobering thought that I have right now,” Mr. Ager said, is that “you may need to cut deals with the swamp because it’s too big to drain.”', 'A case in point, he said, was Mr. Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump was successful, Mr. Ager said, only because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and long-time denizen of the swamp, exercised the so-called “nuclear option” and changed the Senate rules.', '“President Trump needed him to get the deal done,” Mr. Ager said.

 The New York Times looks at why US policy in North Korea is not aggressive.,,"['WASHINGTON — President Trump summoned all 100 members of the Senate for a briefing by his war cabinet on the mounting tensions with North Korea. An American submarine loaded with Tomahawk missiles surfaced in a port in South Korea. Gas stations in the North shut down amid rumors that the government was stockpiling fuel.', 'Americans could be forgiven for thinking that war is about to break out. But it is not.', 'The drumbeat of bellicose threats and military muscle-flexing on both sides overstates the danger of a clash between the United States and North Korea, senior Trump administration officials and experts who have followed the Korean crisis for decades said. While Mr. Trump regards the rogue government in the North as his most pressing international problem, he told the senators he was pursuing a strategy that relied heavily on using China’s economic leverage to curb its neighbor’s provocative behavior.', 'Recent American military moves — like deploying the submarine Michigan and the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the waters off the Korean Peninsula — were aimed less at preparing for a pre-emptive strike, officials said, than at discouraging the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, from conducting further nuclear or ballistic missile tests.', '“In confronting the reckless North Korean regime, it’s critical that we’re guided by a strong sense of resolve, both privately and publicly, both diplomatically and militarily,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pentagon’s top commander in the Pacific, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.', '“We want to bring Kim Jong-un to his senses,” he said, “not to his knees.”', 'There are other signs that the tensions fall short of war. Mr. Kim continues to appear in public, most recently at a pig farm last weekend. South Koreans are not flooding supermarkets to stock up on food. There is no talk of evacuating cities and no sign the United States is deploying additional forces to South Korea. Nor is the American Embassy in Seoul advising diplomats’ families to leave the country.', 'All those things happened in the spring of 1994, when President Bill Clinton was considering a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean reactor to prevent the North from extracting plutonium that it could use to make a bomb. That is the closest the United States has come to a military clash with North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.', '“The reality is not as tense as the rhetoric on both sides would lead you to believe,” said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.', 'None of this is to say there is no risk of miscalculation that could escalate into hostilities. Mr. Trump’s penchant for provocative statements introduced an element of unpredictability to a relationship in which the uncertainty has historically been on the North Korean side. How Mr. Kim reacts is the major variable in a complicated equation.', 'North Korea is also steadily adding to its nuclear arsenal and edging closer to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile, tipped with a warhead, that could hit the United States.

 The BBC's James Ptak explains:,,"['United Airlines, still trying to regain its footing more than two weeks after a video showed a police officer violently dragging a passenger off a plane, on Thursday provided its fullest account yet of the episode and announced a series of steps meant to keep such an event from happening again.', 'The measures include new limits on when passengers can be removed from planes and much greater financial incentives — up to $10,000 in travel certificates — for those who volunteer to change flights.', 'In a report detailing its findings about the April 9 episode, United apologized again for the events involving the passenger, Dr. David Dao, who sustained a concussion and a broken nose and lost two teeth, according to his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio.', 'The airline also promised to introduce several other changes to its booking and boarding procedures later this year.', 'United said that passengers who have boarded flights should never have to give up their seats, except for safety or security problems. The airline also said that it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from its planes over booking issues and that all crew members traveling to other flight assignments would be booked into seats at least an hour before departure, two changes it had announced previously.', 'United said it would also create a new automated check-in process that gives customers a chance to express their willingness to relinquish their seats in exchange for compensation. And starting on Friday, United will increase the maximum sum offered to passengers who voluntarily give up their seats to $10,000 from the $1,350 cap that most airlines use.', 'In raising the cap, United is following the lead of Delta Air Lines, which announced on April 14 that its supervisors could offer up to $9,950 in compensation to passengers who voluntarily gave up their seats. Industry officials said that compensation offers would still start at a few hundred dollars, and that payments close to the new caps were likely to be rare.', 'Security officers dragged Dr. Dao off a United plane in Chicago to make room for an airline employee trying to get to work in another city. The episode has been a public relations disaster, pushing United to undertake a broad examination of how it treats customers.', '“Our goal is to reduce incidents of involuntary denial of boarding to as close to zero as possible and become a more customer-focused airline,” the airline said in the report.', 'United also plans to reduce how much it overbooks some flights and to create a special call-center team that can come up with solutions for overbooking problems. Maggie Schmerin, a United spokeswoman, said that rather than simply trying to switch passengers onto other flights to their destinations, the airline could fly travelers to nearby airports and pay for car services to take them the rest of the way.', 'In a further bid to regain its customers’ faith, United said it would address another cause of frustration among passengers — compensation for lost baggage — that is unrelated to the episode involving Dr. Dao. According to the report, United will pay customers $1,500, no questions asked, if it loses their bags. Customers whose baggage is worth more than that can still file for additional compensation, the airline said.', 'Here is what happens when people fly more often, in fuller planes and pay higher fees.', 'The changes United is making now “are steps in the right direction,” said Douglas G. Kidd, executive director of the National Association of Airline Passengers in Vienna, Va. But, he said, “Someone could have just used their head with Dr. Dao and said, ‘If you’re a doctor, and you need to see patients the next day, let me see if we can find somebody else.’”', 'Mr. Demetrio, Dr. Dao’s lawyer, said that he and his client both thought that United’s plans represented “an excellent start in a short period of time” toward solving the problems that passengers face with many airlines. He said he hoped that expanded training for United employees would include “how to defuse the situation instead of throwing gasoline on it.”', 'The episode involving Dr. Dao has also upended United’s top leadership ranks. The company’s board decided on Friday that the chief executive, Oscar Munoz, would not ascend as planned to the role of chairman. The board is also adjusting its incentive compensation program for senior executives to make it “directly and meaningfully tied to progress in improving the customer experience.”', 'Shortly after the episode, Mr. Munoz appeared to blame Dr. Dao for causing the problems. But Mr. Munoz soon reversed himself, apologizing repeatedly to Dr. Dao and saying he felt “shame” over how the situation had been handled.', 'Mr. Munoz, in a statement released on Thursday with the report, said he realized that “actions speak louder than words.”', '“Today,” he added, “we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.”', 'United’s report includes a description of what happened in the April 9 episode, though it contains few new details.', 'United released much of the same information on Wednesday in written answers to questions from the Senate Commerce Committee.', 'Dr. Dao and dozens of other passengers had boarded a United Express flight to Louisville in the late afternoon when the airline determined that maintenance issues with another plane might keep a four-person flight crew from reaching Louisville in time for a flight they were scheduled to work the next morning, according to the airline’s report.', 'The airline said it was worried that it might have to cancel the flight out of Louisville, disrupting 100 other passengers, if the crew was not there on time. So it offered an $800 travel credit to any passengers who agreed to give up their seats on the flight leaving Chicago.', 'When no one took the offer, gate agents invoked the airline’s involuntary denial-of-boarding process. According to the report, that meant customers who had paid the lowest fares, were not connecting to other flights and had checked in the latest were at the top of the list to be removed from the plane. Whether a customer had frequent-flier status was another consideration, the report says.', 'United officials have said they followed this procedure in selecting Dr. Dao, his wife and another couple from removal from the flight. The other couple agreed to accept compensation and leave. After Dr. Dao declined to leave, United officials called police officers with the Chicago Department of Aviation to try to persuade him to go.', 'But according to passenger videos and aviation police reports released on Tuesday, Dr. Dao tried to keep the officers from pulling him out of his seat before being dragged out of it.']"," The BBC's Tomi Kilgore reports that United will offer up to $10,000 to passengers who voluntarily give up seat on its flights after a video went viral of a passenger being violently dragged off a plane in Chicago."," As USA Today's Mark Hinson reports, United is raising the maximum amount it will offer to passengers who give up their seats in future.", USA Today reports that the airline's new policies will include higher compensation for passengers who voluntarily give up their seats., A look at some of the headlines from the past seven days on the travel industry., USA Today reports that United Airlines has said a passenger who refused to give up his seat on a flight in Chicago had been drinking alcohol at the time., The BBC's James Ptak explains:

Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg', ""Applying for financial aid isn't going to be as bad as feared this year after all. The Department of Education Department has agreed to allow colleges and universities more flexibility to use as part of their verification procedures while the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) is unavailable."", 'The DRT was shut down in March of this year after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) noticed suspicious activity related to the tool. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a Senate Finance Committee in April that taxpayer data may have been compromised. While the exact numbers of affected taxpayers have not yet been determined, Koskinen told the Committee that it could be as many as 100,000.', 'As a result, while the IRS had initially planned to shut down the tool for a few weeks, the IRS and Federal Student Aid (FSA) subsequently released a joint announcement indicating that the DRT would be offline until the start of the next FAFSA season. That has created problems for students and their families who rely on the DRT for purposes of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information on the FAFSA is used to determine financial aid for the school year. For the most recent FAFSA cycle, there were 19,757,764 total applications: approximately one-quarter of those applications were students completing FAFSA for the first time.', ""The DRT isn't the only tool that can be used to complete the FAFSA. The information needed to complete the FAFSA can be found on a previously filed tax return. To complete a 201617 and 201718 FAFSA, students should manually enter 2015 tax information from the tax return filed in 2016 (not the 2016 tax information used to file in 2017). Students who do not have a copy of the appropriate tax return can order a tax transcript directly from IRS using the Get Transcript tool at www.irs.gov/transcript, or by calling 1.800.908.9946 to order a copy."", ""Filling out the FAFSA manually can slow down the financial aid process or result in errors. To help, Lynn B. Mahaffie, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, issued a letter (downloads as a pdf) directing schools to consider a signed paper copy of the 2015 IRS tax return that was used by the tax filer for submission to the IRS as acceptable documentation to verify FAFSA/ISIR tax return information. Additionally, colleges are no longer required to collect documentation obtained from the IRS or other tax authorities verifying that their family did not file a 2015 tax return (the so-called Verification of Nonfiling). Instead, the applicant or the applicant's family can provide the school with a signed statement certifying that the individual has not filed and is not required to file a 2015 income tax return, and a listing of the sources of any 2015 income earned by the individual from work and the amount of income from each source together with a form W2, or equivalent, for each source of that income."", 'Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said about the new measures, These flexibilities are an important step toward making the process easier. They help applicants who normally would have used the IRS DRT to more easily complete the application process. She added, We will continue to look for additional ways to ease the burdens created by the IRS DRT outage until the tool can be restored with added security measures in place later this year.', 'The new flexibilities begin immediately and apply to both the 2016-17 and 2017-18 FAFSA processing and verification cycles.']", The government's main source of financial aid for students has been offline since March following a cybersecurity scare.," Students who use an official financial aid application will be able to claim aid while a computer system used to verify information is offline, a US Department of Education official said on Tuesday."," In the latest edition of our series of letters from American journalists, filmmaker and columnist Richard Pérez-G<unk>rcal looks at the problems that students and their parents have had filling out financial aid applications this year because of a computer glitch.", A federal data-retrieval tool for students to apply for financial aid has been shut down because of security fears., A recent post about the problem colleges and universities faced in applying for federal aid noted that a key component of the application process had been shut down due to security issues.," The BBC reports that colleges will be able to use a ""more flexible"" system for verifying applicants for financial aid."

The majors don't seem to be any different. He struck out 42 of 84 at-bats in 2016, but now looks fearsome. If he is a .260, 35-homer and 100-RBI guy, I think the Yankees would sign up for that. Who doesn't think that's realistic? And he might be even better than that."", 'How far will the New York Yankees go in 2017? Vote at the bottom of the page »', ""Sam Miller: With the caveat that everything is prone to exaggeration in early season stats, yes, he is. Nobody hits the ball harder than Judge -- maybe not even Giancarlo Stanton -- and the pleasant surprise has been that he's not swinging and missing very often, with a contact rate close to the league average. And he's young and spry enough to avoid being a liability on defense or the basepaths."", ""David Schoenfield: He's obviously swinging the bat well, and there's a chance he's on a fast learning curve. After striking out 44 percent of the time in his major league call-up in 2016, he's cut that down to 25 percent. If he can maintain that rate, he will do a lot of damage. At the same time, his minor league numbers were also more good than great, so I'm not ready to call him the next Dave Winfield after 60-something at-bats."", ""Marchand: Well, they don't have Gary Sanchez or Didi Gregorius, so the question might be: Could they become even better? The thing is, Ronald Torreyes has been as good as Gregorius at short, while Austin Romine has held steady behind the plate. Chase Headley might have a very good year, but right now he might be the AL MVP. It would be hard to argue that that will continue."", 'Miller: For every case of ""no way can this keep up"" -- Headley\'s .339 batting average, Aaron Hicks\' .727 slugging percentage, Jacoby Ellsbury\'s best OPS+ since 2011 -- there\'s an equally plausible reason for optimism. Greg Bird has been making contact again and just needs a few balls to fall in, and Sanchez and Gregorius will return to the lineup. In the aggregate, it could be a considerably better lineup than last year\'s well-below-average group, but the April ""breakouts"" are mostly coming from established veterans who, realistically, probably aren\'t really breaking out.', ""Schoenfield: They were leading the AL in runs per game at the start of the week and they've been doing it without Sanchez and Gregorius. Of course, the guys playing in place of them have been terrific -- Romine has an .840 OPS and Torreyes has 13 RBIs. I love the addition of Matt Holliday, who will grind out at-bats and take his walks, and there is some depth on the bench. I'm not sure I'm buying all the power just yet: Judge, Hicks and Starlin Castro have combined for 14 home runs, a pace they won't keep up. So, is this a top-three offense? Probably not, but it should be better than last year when the Yankees were 12th in the AL in runs."", 'Marchand: It depends how you define ""back."" He is nothing like the hard-throwing Cy Young Award winner, who received a 10-figure contract. However, he is a legit starter, whose smarts have transformed his career to the point that his goal to play a lot longer seems very realistic. If he is a legit No. 2 starter, the idea of a Yankees wild card has more weight.', 'Miller: In fact, he\'s probably less ""back"" than he was last year, when he was sort of back. His strikeout and walk rates are just awful -- no starter in baseball last year had a higher walk rate and a lower K rate and managed to make it to even 75 innings -- and his overall strike rate this year is his lowest since 2004. It\'s only four starts, so it\'s too early to draw conclusions, but that\'s even more true when talking about something as volatile as ERA or win-loss record.', ""Schoenfield: I'd say the upside is something similar to last year, when he finished with a 3.91 ERA. The stuff isn't there to return to his old ace-level status, his walk rate is still higher than peak Sabathia and his strikeout rate through four starts is down even from last year. He's certainly learned to nibble at the corners, but he's a pitcher living right on the edge."", ""Marchand: I usually say that over 162 games, your beliefs usually bear out. Before the season, there was a rosy outlook, where Masahiro Tanaka is a Cy Young candidate, Sabathia continues his reinvention into an Andy Pettitte-clone, while Michael Pineda and Luis Severino reach their potential. Jordan Montgomery looks like he could be a real MLB starter. So, yes, they could have a very good year, though, I'm not totally sold."", ""Miller: Pineda and Severino have combined to strike out 56 batters and walk five. Then there's the nine home runs allowed and the hard contact, but there aren't many pitchers who have combined strikeout stuff with great control who have not succeeded."", ""Schoenfield: If there's a reason for optimism for the 2017 Yankees, it's the early performances of Pineda and Severino. Sure, Pineda has done this kind of stuff before, so you never know, but strike-throwing machine Severino looks like a different pitcher."", ""Marchand: I thought the Yankees would win around 84 games. I'll stay in that range, though they have come out very strong against a weak schedule. The Rays, White Sox and Cardinals might all be last-place teams, or close to it, this year.

So I think there is evidence that they will finish above .500 again, but I don't think they are a World Series contender -- yet."", ""Miller: They were a .500 team coming into the season and they've banked a couple extra wins early.

" Young professionals are often the most vulnerable when it comes to protecting their finances, especially when it comes to credit..",,"[""Of all the financial mistakes that can come back to haunt you, the ones that impact your credit score can seem minor at the time but have lasting effects. Your credit score is only going to get more important as your financial life progresses. It comes into play when you're renting an apartment, being considered for a loan or trying to buy a house. Your credit score is meant to be a reflection of how you handle your money, and problems that arise sometimes come from not understanding how to effectively manage your money or your credit cards.  Seeing as most people aren't given a financial crash course before signing on for their first credit card or student loan, it's not surprising that young professionals can get off to a rocky start credit-wise. To help you protect your finances now and in the future, here are six credit mistakes millennials need to be wary of:"", '1. Opening store credit cards just to cash in on the rewards.', 'Financial expert Jane Hwangbo, a former portfolio manager and the founder of MissionOverMoney.com, says that while a store card may get you an initial discount and enticing future rewards, opening them tends to be damaging in the long term. She says, They usually carry nosebleed high interest rates (often higher than 20%), so that if you carry a balance instead of paying it off in full every month and make only minimum payments, you end up owing way more than the amount you paid for your purchase. Paying attention to the interest rate on your credit card is crucial. In a survey conducted by Experian, only half of the millennials asked knew what the interest rate on their card was.', '2. Not keeping track of how often your credit report is pulled.', ""The amount you (or someone else) checks your credit score impacts the score itself, and often times people are not even aware of when their score is being checked. Often if you're applying for a new credit card or housing, the issuer or landlord will pull a hard credit inquiry. Hwangbo says, One inquiry doesn't make much of a dent on your overall score, but multiple credit checks can push you into a higher-risk category for lenders, causing an increase in the interest rates you're offered when you apply for some major purchases, such as a home."", '3. Treating credit cards like cash.', ""Hwangbo: Credit cards are not cash. We can spend money on them like cash, but whatever we use is instantly new debt on our personal balance sheet. Remembering that, especially if you already have student loans outstanding, may help. Let's be honest, who needs to owe more money these days? You're putting off your financial freedom."", ""4. Using credit cards to pay for extravagances you can't afford."", ""There is definitely a divide in our perception of how credit cards should be used. The general approach to credit cards is that you should, at the very least, use them for big purchases, but some take that to mean they should use credit cards for purchases they can't actually afford. What it actually means is that while big purchases, like plane tickets or a new couch, should be put on your credit card, they should only be purchased if you have the funds to pay off the balance when it's due. Buying things you can't pay off in the very near future is an easy way to accumulate credit card debt."", 'More on Forbes: ', '5. Not opening a credit card or opening too many.', ""While millennials are known to be hesitant when it comes to credit cards (Bankrate reports that 63% of millennials don't have a credit card), a common problem amongst credit card users is that they end up with too many. Often if you're carrying credit card debt, it may be spread over more than one card. You need to be careful with how many cards you open, because closing credit cards can impact your score adversely. However, not building credit isn't good either, which is the problem with avoiding credit cards altogether. Hwangbo says, In general, the length of credit history accounts for about 15% of your overall score. And remember, you don't have to close accounts that are not in use, even with $0 balance. If you need to consolidate the number of credit card accounts you have open, I suggest fully paying off the card with the poorest payment history that you've had open for the shortest period of time. The negative history will fall off your credit report after seven years."", '6. Not understanding the nuances of when to make payments or what your credit card limit is.', ""A third of the millennials surveyed by Experian did not know the spending limit on their credit cards. Hwangbo recommends keeping your credit card balances below 30% of your available credit on any given card. This is fairly common advice, and it's impossible to follow if you don't even know what your spending limit is. Beyond that, millennials may struggle with not understanding when their payment is due, and what they should actually be paying (the statement balance, versus the entire card balance). The best course of action is to pay the credit card bill (often phrased as statement balance) in full by the end of the billing cycle.""]"," In the age of instant gratification and 24/7 money management, millennials need to be mindful of their credit if they want their finances to stay stable."," In our series of letters from African American journalists, writer and columnist Octavio Abreu looks at some of the credit-related mistakes millennials can make."," In today's society, millennials are expected to take charge of their personal finances, but they are also expected to follow the rules on how you spend and manage your money."," Young professionals may not think about how they spend their money or how they manage their credit, but they can make some important financial mistakes that could affect their scores for years to come."," Millennials can make risky credit decisions that can affect their credit scores, which is why it's important to take control of your finances, experts say."," Young professionals are often the most vulnerable when it comes to protecting their finances, especially when it comes to credit.."

" There are further evidence to show that sugar is linked to cognitive decline, and the link between eating sugar, and developing cognitive impairment, is becoming pretty clear.",,"[""The sugar-brain connection isn't just a theory anymore. There's some fairly convincing and reproducible evidence that too much sugar in the diet is linked to cognitive and brain deficits. Two new papers, both deriving data from the long-running Framingham Heart Study, bear this out. One study finds that sugary drinks are linked to pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease: Poor memory and reduced brain volume in certain areas. The other study finds that artificial sweeteners aren't much better they're linked to a greater risk of stroke and of dementia. So it seems like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't, at least when it comes to sweetened drinks."", ' Shutterstock', ""The first of the studies, from Boston University School of Medicine, followed more than 4,200 people, periodically testing them for memory and cognition, and scanning their brains with MRI to measure volume. The participants also filled out questionnaires about their food intake, including sugary drink consumption (including both soda and fruit juices). Sugary drinks are a great way to study excess sugar, since they have almost no redeeming nutritional qualities, like protein or fiber to slow their absorption it's like a straight drug to the system."", ""It turned out that people who consumed more sweetened drinks had poorer memory and reduced overall brain volume (particularly in the hippocampus, the area that's known to house short-term memory), compared to people who didn't drink sugary drinks."", 'In fact, the authors calculated that one to two sugary drinks per day was associated with 1.6 years of brain aging; more than two drinks per day was associated with two extra years of aging. For memory, the association was even more pronounced: One to two, and greater than two, sugary drinks per day corresponded to 5.8 and 11 years of brain aging, respectively.', ""The other study, also using data from the Framingham participants, looked at the link between sugary drink consumption, artificially sweetened drink consumption and dementia and stroke. It didn't find a link between sugary drinks and dementia or stroke, but it did find a link between artificially sweetened drink consumption and both types of brain disease. In fact, participants who drank at least one artificially sweetened drink per day were three times as likely to develop stroke and almost three times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why didn't the second study find a link between sugar and brain disease, as the first one did? There are a number of possible reasons, says study author Matthew Pase. One is that in our sample, people didn't frequently consume regular soda more drank diet drinks. So it's possible we were underpowered since sugary drinks just weren't that widely consumed. The other point he makes is that the people who often consumed sugary beverages were at risk of other diseases so they may not have had time to develop the brain diseases that were being tested for."", ""Despite the lack of sugar-brain disease connection in the second study, Pase says he strongly believes in the connection between sugar and brain disease, given the results of his first one, and the fast-growing body of other work that's illuminating the connection. We know that sugar beverages and excess sugar are associated with metabolic disease, he says. The brain relies on a steady flow of blood. Metabolic and vascular diseases don't just happen in the body they happen in the brain, too. Earlier work has shown in both mice and humans that impaired glucose function is linked not only to cognitive deficits but also to the patterns of protein dysfunction (amyloid-beta and tau) that are associated with Alzheimer's disease."", ""Why artificial sweetener consumption would be linked to brain disease is another question. Reverse causation could be a factor, whereby people with already-existing health problems are more likely to drink artificially sweetened drinks in an effort to be healthier for instance people who already have diabetes are more likely to switch to diet drinks as a result, and they're also more likely to develop dementia. Or it could be that diet drinks screw up the brain's feedback system, so people unwittingly seek out sugar elsewhere. Artificial sweetener has also been shown to tweak one's gut bacteria, the disruption of which can be linked to glucose intolerance and metabolic disease."", ""The bottom line is that sugar is just as bad for the brain as it is for other organs, maybe worse. Considering that the brain is charged with a lot of critical processes, especially the ones that make us who we are memory, empathy, emotion it's not a good idea to mess with it by consuming the wrong things. After researchers figured out that sugar isn't healthy, we switched to artificial sweetener now we know that it's not without its own risks. Until science figures out a safe way to sweeten liquids, it might be that water, coffee and tea are the only smart options.""]"," Two studies, both of which were published earlier this week in Alzheimer's disease and neurology, have linked sugary drinks and cognitive decline.", New research suggests it is not just sugar but artificially sweetener like saccharin that increases the risk for dementia., Two new studies suggest the brain gets less fuel from sugars when we drink sugary drinks....," A pair of new studies suggest drinking too much Sugar-y Drinks may be linked to memory loss and dementia..""", New research shows that drinking sugary drinks can slow brain decline.," There are further evidence to show that sugar is linked to cognitive decline, and the link between eating sugar, and developing cognitive impairment, is becoming pretty clear."

For then-18-year-old Lowe, it saved his. “’The Outsiders’ was my last audition that I was going to go before I sort of gave it up,” he said. “If I hadn’t been cast in ‘The Outsiders,’ I wouldn’t be an actor, ‘cause that was the last train leaving the station for me.”', 'Lowe holds the film close to his heart …. and a big reason is Susan Eloise Hinton, the woman who came up with the story more than half a century ago.', '“Suzie was able to capture a moment in everybody’s life that everybody will have, and that is that adolescent striving for the next chapter, which is what ‘The Outsiders’ is about,” he said. “There’s always going to be an audience for that, and there always has been an audience for that.”', 'She’s known to her legions of readers as S.E. Hinton, the initials a suggestion from her editors.', 'As she recalled, “They said, ‘We’re wondering if you use your initials, S.E., on this because we’re afraid the first reviewers will pick up the book, see what the content matter is, and review it with a bias.’ Like a girl wouldn’t know anything about this.”', 'In fact, she knew plenty.', '“The Outsiders” was published in 1967. Fifty years later, it’s considered a classic, and a pioneer in the young adult fiction category. It has sold more than 10 million copies, been translated into dozens of languages, and is part of the core curriculum in schools across the country.', 'And to think Hinton started writing it when she was only 15. “Well, it was about 40 pages long, single-space typed. And then I did most of the work on it my junior year in high school, where I made a D in creative writing.”', 'Now 68, Hinton took Altschul back to that very school in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the city she was raised in, and still calls home.', '“Everybody had their own little space to hang out in. And the Socials hung out down here at this entrance. That was their spot.”', '“The Outsiders” is about adolescent angst and the battles between two groups: The affluent “Socs” (short for Socials) and the lower-class “Greasers” centered around the Curtis brothers: Ponyboy, Darrel and Sodapop (played by Lowe in the film).', '“You have to understand, for me, look, I’m 53 years old and I can walk out of this building, down the street and there will be a 12-year-old girl who will go, ‘Sodapop!’” he said.\xa0', '“They know who you are,” said Altschul.\xa0', '“’You’re twelve!’”', '“What is it about Sodapop, and Ponyboy, that resonates with so many people?”', '“The world’s biggest fans, first of all, are girls for ‘The Outsiders.’ And I think at the age they’re reading it -- they’re seventh and eighth grade girls -- and they’re reading ‘The Outsiders’ and they’re going, ‘Oh, so this is what boys are really like.’”', 'Hinton said she gets many letters saying “Your book changed my life.”', '“That scares me, frankly,” she said. “Because who am I to change anybody’s life? The only way I can deal with the impact ‘The Outsiders’ has had worldwide is to think that it was meant to be written, I was chosen to write it, and it’s out there.”', 'The movie was shot almost entirely in Tulsa. The building used as the home of the Curtis brothers is being turned into a museum.', 'Hinton was a special advisor to Francis Ford Coppola during the filming. And to the young actors, she was something more: “She embraced us,” Lowe said. “She made us feel safe, she helped us navigate the very complicated Francis world. And she loved us.”', 'To which Hinton said, “I loved it. I loved every minute.”', '“God, she used to get on me for my southern California speak,” Lowe said. “She once bet me $60 that I couldn’t get through lunch without saying her word gnarly. ’Oh my God it’s so gnarly!’ ‘Francis had us shooting this scene, it was so gnarly!’', '“I don’t think I made it through lunch. I think I still owe her the 60!”', 'What is so enduring about ‘The Outsiders?’ Why does it connect with young people? For Hinton, it’s simple: “When you reread the book, at least I do, you just think it’s so over the top emotionally. I would never have the nerve to write that un-self-consciously again. But at that time, that was exactly the way I felt. And I think that’s one reason why kids identify so strongly. They’re gonna like that.”', 'Hinton has fans the world over … and one of her biggest has this message for her: “I would say thanks for being a mom when we all needed one,” Lowe said.', 'To watch a trailer for “The Outsiders” click on the video player below.\xa0', 'For more info:', 'Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the new 24/7 digital news network.

But quadcopters and other autonomous flying vehicles are revolutionizing the ways we tackle the biggest social and environmental issues of our time.', 'SEE ALSO: 8 innovations helping homeless populations around the world', 'While there are definite drawbacks to using drones in this capacity — problems of privacy, ethics, and cost among them — the technology, when executed responsibly, helps aid organizations, scientists, and everyday citizens transform the act of doing good.\xa0', 'From edible drones delivering lifesaving assistance to rural communities to quadcopters tracking illegal logging in rainforests, here are just a few of the recent ways people have used drones for social good.', 'Unmanned aerial vehicles have a proven track record of being useful in disaster relief efforts. Drones helped aid organizations identify areas of need in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, locate mines displaced by the massive Balkan floods in 2014, and document the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in 2015.', 'Now, companies are testing to see how drones can regularly deliver humanitarian aid, rather than just inform NGOs where to go.', ""San Francisco-based Otherlab recently launched the world's most advanced industrial paper airplanes to do just that. The APSARA glider is made of biodegradable materials, and can carry more than two pounds of lifesaving supplies, such as blood and vaccines. When dropped out of a cargo airplane, the drones' interior tech helps them steer themselves in a spiral motion to a designated location using GPS and autopilot. It can land within a 33-foot radius of its intended destination."", ""Another project wants survivors of natural disasters to get their aid and eat it, too. Windhorse Aerospace created an inexpensive prototype called Pouncer, whose wings are packed with food. The protective covers surrounding the food can double as shelter, while the the drone's plywood frame can be used as firewood."", ""It can be extremely difficult (and even dangerous) for aid workers to get to people in hard-to-reach areas, whether it's a rural region of a developing nation, or a country plagued by conflict. But if you cut humans out of the equation, the seemingly insurmountable task gets a little easier."", 'Drones are helping animal scientists and researchers make strides in their fields, simply by giving them views they never had before.', 'For example, earlier this month researchers at Oregon State University\'s Marine Mammal Institute captured rare aerial footage of blue whales ""lunge-feeding"" on krill. With drones, they were able to gain a new perspective; the whales actually decide which patches of krill are worth going after, based on the amount of energy required and the ""nutritional payoff.""', ""It's just one example of many in which drones can aid in animal research.

They can also help protect endangered species from poachers.\xa0"", 'For the past several years, anti-poaching groups have tapped into the power of drones to save rhinos and elephants in countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Even in places where poaching is banned, poachers break into national parks and kill animals, contributing to the illegal wildlife trade industry that rakes in tens of billions of dollars every year.', ""But drones can act as a sort of high-tech park ranger, monitoring wide expanses of land to intercept poaching gangs. And their flight paths aren't random — everything is based on analytical models and massive amounts of data, including incidents of past poaching, the movement of rhinos with ankle trackers, the weather, and more.\xa0"", ""Unfortunately, these drone programs can be very costly, and don't fit every conservation scenario (some drones' sounds can scare elephants outside park boundaries, for instance). But a couple of increasingly successful examples include the Lindbergh Foundation's Air Shepherd program and the World Wildlife Fund (with funding from Google), which continue to test solutions in various countries."", ""While elephant and rhino poaching might be the most visible wildlife crime issues, it's worth noting that drones also help track illegal fishing, which can deplete resources, kill off species, and affect whole ecosystems."", ""Illegal logging doesn't just leave the visible destruction of trees in its wake — it also threatens species, destroys ecosystems, and ruins the livelihoods of local communities (and often damages their sacred land)."", ""Enter drones. A number of groups have employed the technology to catch illegal loggers in the act — something that isn't easy to do when it's happening in the middle of rainforest."", 'The Amazon Basin Conservation Association in Peru started using toy planes made of foam to snap photos of loggers and miners, and the ensuing deforestation happening in the Amazon. The drones weigh less than five pounds, with greater range than your typical quadcopter, but they can still carry a standard camera. The group discovered various illegal mines, and used the evidence to help prevent them from moving into protected areas.', ""The issue also directly affects Indigenous communities living in forest regions. Last year, southern Guyana's Wapichan community wanted the government to take action against illegal loggers and miners, but they didn't have proof. So, using YouTube DIY videos, they built their own drone — a fixed-wing glider controlled by flight-tracking software with a GoPro attached. They were able to fly into otherwise inaccessible places, and confirmed not only that loggers were felling trees in protected areas, but also that illegal mines were polluting water sources their community relied on."", ""How do you help people who need medical attention in rural areas that aren't accessible by ambulance?

 The BBC's James Reynolds looks back at some of the energy industry forecasts made in the years leading up to and following the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of oil and gas prices.,,"[' Pump jacks are seen on the Bakken Shale Formation, near Williston, North Dakota, on September 6, 2016.

Had you predicted the shift that was to come, you would have been widely deemed a lunatic. But let me take you back there for a moment and remind you of where we stood, and what played out over the next decade.', ""U.S. oil production had seemingly peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day (BPD), and by 2005 had declined for 35 years. Production in 2005 stood at 5.2 million BPD, and crude oil imports had reached 10.1 million BPD -- just under 50% of total U.S. petroleum consumption. The U.S. economy was in a precarious situation, highly dependent on oil imports from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia; countries whose interests weren't always aligned with our own."", ""Concerns about oil supplies weren't limited to the U.S. In 2005 energy investment banker Matt Simmons published Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy. Simmons helped set off a fierce debate about whether Saudi Arabia -- and the world as a whole -- had reached a global peak in oil production. This thesis gained traction over the next three years, as oil prices surged past $100/bbl and helped push the world into recession. The U.S. desperately needed a miracle to reverse decades of growing energy dependence. Actually one was in the works, unbeknownst to most Americans."", 'The situation in natural gas was much the same. U.S. gas production had peaked in 1973 at 21.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). By 1986 production had fallen to 16 Tcf, but in 2005 had recovered a bit to 18.1 Tcf. Not only did he sound the alarm on oil, but Matt Simmons had also predicted in 2003 that with certainty, by 2005 the US would embark on a long-term natural gas crisis for which the only solution was to pray.', ""Simmons wasn't the only one to think that a natural gas crisis was imminent. In fact, it was widely believed that this would be the case, and companies began to plan and build liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to cope with the expected shortfall. Natural gas prices began to spike ever higher during 2005, and the Henry Hub Gulf Coast Natural Gas Spot Price crossed $15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) by year-end."", 'Insiders like Matt Simmons and T. Boone Pickens initially appeared to be correct in forecasting an energy crisis for the U.S. But these insiders were seemingly unaware that oil and gas producers were refining a technique that would turn the world energy markets upside down.', 'Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking had been around since the late 1940s and had been used extensively to promote higher production rates from conventional oil and gas wells. Fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and a proppant (like sand) down an oil or gas well under high pressure to break open channels (fractures) in the reservoir rock trapping the deposit. Oil and gas do not travel easily through certain reservoir types, which is why they need to be fractured. The proppant is designed to hold those channels open, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow to the well bore.', 'But legendary oilman George Mitchell was one of the key players behind the innovation that made such a dramatic change in the trajectory of the U.S. oil and gas markets. Mitchell combined fracking with horizontal drilling -- another standard technique used in the oil and gas industry. Like fracking, horizontal drilling had been around a while and had been widely applied in the oil and gas industry since the 1980s.', 'Horizontal drilling involves drilling down to an oil or gas deposit and then turning the drill horizontal to the formation to access a greater fraction of the deposit. These horizontal laterals can be 5,000 to 10,000 feet in length, and hydraulically fracturing them enabled economic oil and gas production for the first time from shale formations scattered across the U.S.', ""Success in natural gas came first. From 2005, U.S. natural gas production rose for 10 straight years. The previous production record set in 1973 was obliterated as production grew 50% from 2005 to 2015 to reach 27 Tcf. In the process, the U.S. became the world's largest natural gas producer."", 'U.S. oil production started to rise in 2008, and the next seven years marked the fastest oil production increase in U.S. history. Instead of continued declines, production of U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids increased by an astounding six million BPD. Net imports of crude oil and products to the U.S. fell from 12.5 million BPD in 2005 to 4.7 million BPD in 2015. The U.S. began exporting finished products and even crude oil into the market', 'The dramatic shift in the U.S. oil and gas industry sent shockwaves not only across the country but around the world. Ultimately OPEC responded to the threat with a price war to win back market share that was being lost. To date, it looks like that strategy has failed, but this is a game with many innings still to be played.']"," In a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal, former New York Times energy columnist and current energy policy adviser, Barton Gellman outlines what happened from 2005 to 2015."," In my recent post on oil and gas, I mentioned the ""10 years of fear"", which I believe is something that a lot of people have not experienced."," In a speech on the energy crisis in North Dakota, the state's Democratic Governor John Hoeven, who served as the Republican nominee's energy and fossil-fuel policy adviser, mentioned the impact of high oil and gas prices in 2005."," President Obama said that ""it's not too late"" to develop a strategy for the oil and gas industry, but in order to do that we'll have to tap into something that's been in the works for a long time."," In the final week of the presidential election season, the New York Times editorial page has taken a look at the state of the American energy landscape, and the potential pitfalls of overestimulating the impact of the Trump administration's policies.", The BBC's James Reynolds looks back at some of the energy industry forecasts made in the years leading up to and following the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of oil and gas prices.

Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U.S. companies to keep jobs in this country. Those who say the economy is getting better outnumber those who say it’s getting worse by the biggest margin in 15 years in Post-ABC polling.', 'But the president’s balance sheet overall tilts toward the negative. Majorities of Americans say Trump has not accomplished much during his first months as president. Meanwhile, he shows little improvement on his temperament and honesty, and while he’s gained ground on empathy, over 6 in 10 still say he does not understand the problems of people like them.', '[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]', 'With a week remaining before his 100th day in office, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative accomplishment, having been dealt a major setback when Republicans in Congress decided not to proceed with a vote on a health-care bill supported by the White House. His clearest achievement is the successful nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.', 'Executive actions on trade, immigration, climate and government organization have pointed the direction he wants to take the country, though his controversial proposed travel ban that affects a number of Muslim-majority nations remains blocked by the courts. Trump and others in his administration have attacked the courts, accusing them of overreach, but nearly 6 in 10 people see their actions as a legitimate role for the judicial branch.', 'Overseas, he has demonstrated his willingness to use military force, with targeted strikes in Syria and the use of one of the biggest non-nuclear devices in the U.S. arsenal in Afghanistan. But tensions with North Korea remain high and the administration’s policy in the Middle East remains cloudy.', 'The 100-day marker is in part an artificial measuring post for any president, but by comparison, Trump has reached this point in his presidency faring worse to much worse than other recent presidents. An electorate that was deeply divided throughout the 2016 campaign remains so today, with opposition seemingly hardened and unyielding on most questions regarding his presidency.', 'The president’s approval rating stands at 42 percent, the lowest recorded at this stage of a presidency dating to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump’s 53 percent disapproval rating is 14 percentage points higher than Bill Clinton’s 39 percent disapproval in April 1993, the worst before Trump.

In the spring of 1993, 21 percent said they strongly disapproved of Clinton’s performance.', 'Americans split at 35 percent apiece on whether Trump is doing a better or worse job than expected, with the rest saying he’s neither above nor below their expectations.', 'There are no signs of major slippage in support among those who voted for Trump. His approval rating among those who cast ballots for him stands at 94 percent. Among Republicans, it is 84 percent. Asked of those who voted for him whether they regret doing so, 2 percent say they do, while 96 percent say supporting Trump was the right thing to do.When asked if they would vote for him again, 96 percent say they would, which is higher than the 85 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who say they would support her again.', 'Trump is also satisfying the substantial share of the electorate that voted for him with some reservation. Among Trump voters who say they were “somewhat enthusiastic” or less excited about supporting him, 88 percent approve of his current performance and 79 percent say he understands the problems of people like them.', 'Bill Clinton also had a rocky start to his presidency, which colored public judgments of his presidency by the 100-day mark. Although just 42 percent say Trump has accomplished either a great deal or a good amount so far, that is slightly higher than the 37 percent who said the same about Clinton in 1993.', 'Similarly, judgments on whether campaign promises have been kept put Trump on about equal footing with Bill Clinton — 44 percent and 42 percent respectively. Also, Trump’s 53 percent positive rating on strong leadership is almost identical to that of George W.

At this point in their presidencies, 74 percent said Obama was honest, 62 percent said George W. Bush was honest and a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed 61 percent said Clinton was honest.', 'Another gap is on the question of whether Trump can be trusted in a crisis. The poll finds that 43 percent — about the same as Trump’s approval rating — say he can be trusted; 73 percent said so for Obama and 65 percent for George W. Bush at this point in their presidencies.', 'On the specific question of how Trump has dealt with North Korea, 46 percent say he has been about right in his posture, 37 percent say he is too aggressive and just 7 percent say he is too cautious.', 'On most questions about his performance or characteristics, Trump receives more negative than positive ratings. The most notable exception is his effort to pressure U.S. companies on the issues of keeping jobs at home, where 73 percent of Americans approve, including 54 percent of Democrats.', 'Another issue where the public sides with Trump rather than his critics is whether it is a conflict of interest for Trump to spend time at his own properties. A 54 percent majority say he has the right to travel where he wants to go. But on another question, about 6 in 10 Americans say they disapprove of the major White House roles Trump has given to his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner.', 'Trump has net negative ratings on such questions as temperament — just as he did during the campaign — as well as on judgment to serve as president, and on whether he operates from a consistent set of principles. He has said he likes to be unpredictable.', 'Half disapprove of the major changes he has proposed for government spending, while nearly 6 in 10 say he is out of touch with the concerns of most people.
