Zimmerman stands to benefit significantly from the $112.5 million fund, as well as through individual retainer fees, but he says that's not unusual or problematic in class-action cases."", '""That\'s not double dipping,"" Zimmerman told Outside the Lines. ""It happens in every case."" In a different case he worked on, ""The common benefit fund applied to people who did common benefit work, and the contingency was for individual contracts with clients. You can\'t get paid twice for the same work, you can get paid for each. They\'re very separate. You\'re getting paid to do work on an individual\'s medical case, submitting it for compensation and advising and directing the individual injury case through different channels it has to go through to get it paid. That happens in law, in every fund that you\'ve ever seen developed in a mass tort case.""', 'Luckasevic and other lawyers have complained that Seeger is effectively the puppet master over the $112.5 million. Assuming the judge approves the plan, Seeger will oversee the distribution of the money. Luckasevic believes he should be compensated for the thousands of hours he spent researching and building toward filing in 2011.', '""If he really believes that to be true,"" said Seeger, ""he needs to file the papers and make that argument to the judge and ask her to award him whatever he thinks is fair."" Seeger also suggested that Luckasevic has overstated his value to the case.', 'Luckasevic, several other lawyers and many of the wives interviewed are particularly angered by an additional 5 percent ""hold back"" that Seeger has requested to cover future legal work that could be done over the 65 years the deal is in play.', ""Court records show the 5 percent -- which could amount to as much as $50 million -- would be drawn from the individual lawyers' retainer fees rather than from the players' awards; or, if a player is working without an attorney, it would come out of their share."", '""Why would they need an extra 5 percent when they spent all that time negotiating for the $112 million?"" said Catherina Watters, a lawyer who represents several players in disability claims and is working pro bono in the concussion case for Steve Smith, a former NFL running back suffering from ALS. Watters, whose husband is former NFL running back Ricky Watters, helped draft the letter with Nicholson, and she says she told the wives their focus now should be less on any ire they feel toward the league and more on ""What the lawyers are doing to our players. Why are they continuing to take?""', 'Several lawyers, including Luckasevic, filed objections to the 5 percent hold back, asking the judge either to dump it altogether or reduce it to as low as 1 percent.', '""You want my $700,000 [from the common fund], Chris, have it, choke on it,"" says Luckasevic. ""Just don\'t take 5 percent of my hard work. You didn\'t put this case together, you didn\'t sign up guys that were truly injured. You didn\'t rep them for 5 1/2 years. I did that work, don\'t go reaching into my pants.""', 'Said Seeger: ""We believe the set-aside is appropriate, as substantial future efforts will be necessary for the common benefit of the class over the 65-year life of the settlement.""', ""Seeger has engendered considerable enmity from fellow attorneys throughout the case, and his request for his share of the $112.5 million probably has done nothing to ease those feelings. He calculated his firm put in more than 21,000 hours over the past four years, amassing fees of $18,124,869.10. Seeger alone billed for 6,955 hours -- or the equivalent of 290 full days -- at a rate of $985 an hour, for $6,851,561.50 in fees. The petition for fees asks the judge to assign a multiplier of 2.6 to the fees and expenses, which, if applied, would garner Seeger's firm more than $51 million."", ""In addition to playing a lead role in the lawsuit against the NFL, Seeger and his firm, according to the firm's website, have had ongoing leadership roles over the past several years in dozens of class-action cases, including several involving pharmaceutical products."", 'Asked about his fees and the amount of money he stands to gain from the NFL case, Seeger said, ""I can tell you 100 percent confidently that I worked exclusively on the NFL for 2 years.

Which Late-Night SXSW Party Claimed The Illmore’s Throne?, journalist LizznoFolding explains the mystery behind the new music festival called The Illmore which apparently cropped up in the,"['People started noticing the posters on Thursday afternoon. Loud advertisements climb the lightpoles of Austin, Texas in March—for rappers, labels, and parties, the latest pushing the old ones up and out of sight. They’re competing for the eyes of the hip, music industry-affiliated crowd attending SXSW—but the posters that had people pulling out smartphones to take a picture and frantically text to friends were simple: All black, with white text that simply read “The Illmore.”', 'It became a game. Suddenly, everyone was talking: “Do you think it’s real?” At the bottom of each poster was a web address, illmore.party, which took you to a similarly sparse site: again, all-black, with a simple prompt to enter an email address. When you did, a slyly winking emoji appeared—the one you send to someone you know you’re getting somewhere with. Not exactly the most helpful sign.', 'The reason this poster had Austin buzzing—and excitedly attempting to assess its veracity—was the name the Illmore. For the past 6 years, the Illmore had been synonymous with SXSW and hip-hop for a simple reason: it was the best party in town. Each year, when Austin developed into the musical center of the universe for a few days, the Illmore held the vaunted title of Place To Be. It’s where Chance The Rapper would show up, or 2 Chainz drop in for a surprise set. It’s where A-list rappers, unbilled, performed—but it was also where they hung out. For someone looking for the best night of your life, you can party-hop, sure, or you could focus all your efforts on getting into the place you know is going to be great (and whose blocks-long lines nearly always required some finessing to make it through the doors). The Illmore was unpredictable, but it was also consistent.', 'The problem? There was no Illmore in 2017. So when posters showed up, knowingly understated, people were excited at having seemingly stumbled upon a secret. The party never happened—the email address I left at the site remains uncontacted—but it’s a sign of the Illmore’s power that it took so little to get people riled up (the only rival it had for a it’s-probably-not-going-to-happen-but-I’m-going-to-get-excited-anyway party rumor was an extremely improbable secret Frank Ocean show). Instead, more than in years past, 2017 became a place for finding new parties—your night depended on it.\xa0', 'Two of the standouts last week at SXSW were thrown by streaming services. YouTube, which had a space on Trinity Street populated by excited crowds and six (6!) open bars. Lists and badges were required, but if you were lucky enough to get in, the video platform knew how to book its headliners. Solange Knowles, Rae Sremmurd, and Migos took the stage on consecutive nights and Solange in particular gave a stunning performance, leading a troupe of purple-clad musicians who danced, with synchronous throwback moves, behind her. It’s the kind of show that can only happen at SXSW—a true star in a smaller venue than you will ever see them again. Apple, too, threw a lavishly well-manicured party, featuring up-and-coming rappers Young M.A and 6lack one night, and morbid pop songstress Lana Del Rey the next.\xa0', 'Outside of the well-heeled Silicon Valley set, labels were still throwing parties this year, as always. And, with young artists seemingly getting snapped up earlier and earlier every year—take Maggie Rogers, for instance, who signed with Universal off of (well-deserved) internet buzz before she had as much as an EP to her name—the parties and showcases thrown by labels like UMG, Epic, and Atlantic Records became just as much a place to discover talent as catch their marquee acts.', 'Austin still had some surprises, even without The Illmore. Shows like Revolt’s Swishahouse reunion show, featuring Texas’ biggest mid-2000’s stars like Mike Jones, Paul Wall, and Slim Thug—still beloved for “Still Tippin’”—proved that SXSW, if nothing else, is a place to find something you may not have known was even on offer until you touch down in Austin.\xa0']"

She's now 13, producing her own candles, and projecting that her company will earn $100,000 in revenue in 2017. (For 2016, she projected $70,000  and made $69,128.30.) More importantly, she has also trained 40 of her peers young kids in Detroit to be entrepreneurs, which is to say Newsom has created power and possibility across a whole community. How did she do it? She followed the classic entrepreneur's path. She had a mentor   her dad. She found a great business opportunity. And she kept going, thriving despite (or because of) of all the challenges that came her way. She calls herself Super Business Girl, and she is."", 'What drew Newson to entrepreneurship?

We never really saw her because she was always at work helping someone else build their dream, Newson explains.', ""My dad was an entrepreneur...he didn't have as much structure as my mom. He sold candles when he was young, and he taught me a lot about it. I was able to sell candles with him, and it was really fun. I wanted to own my own company so I can have more fun and have way more freedom."", ""That's exactly why I do what I do. I love that."", 'Her business has evolved over time. Just like any other entrepreneur, Newson has faced challenges that required her to creatively rethink her pricing, her business model and her sales strategy. When conditions shifted, she shifted with them, turning challenge into opportunity. Her first challenge: growing up.', "" my dad would take us downtown or door to door to sell the candles. At the time we were buying the candles for a dollar and selling them for $10, but people didn't care because we were just so little and cute. After awhile...as I was getting older, people wasn't saying, 'Oh, you're cute,' now, so I wasn't able to buy a dollar candle and sell it for $10, Newson said. As I got older people think I was running a scam, or I was taking my money and using it for something bad   whatever they thought I was doing. They started discouraging me a little bit, and then the security guards were kind of kicking me off the property, and telling me I can't sell candles in front of this store or that store. I really didn't know what to do."", ""Newson found one temporary fix; she enlisted her mom's help and got a business license. After work one day my mom drove me, and we got all of our paperwork done. That was a relief, because now when I went back downtown to sell my candles, they would say, 'Hey, you need a permit to sell or you can't sell,' and I would just whip it out like, 'Here, you see? You see?'"", ""However, by this time, Newson already had 20 trainees and the security guards' questions continued   particularly downtown. But that's where she needed to be. In Detroit, downtown is where the money is. She needed a bigger solution. That came in the form of Quicken Loans founder, Dan Gilbert  Gilbert is one of the big-name entrepreneurs who has been quietly helping to rebuild downtown Detroit. And, interestingly, it was solved by the exact thing that seemed to be her biggest challenge."", ""One day I was walking down Woodward Avenue, and I ran into .

I was like, 'Yes!'"", ' (Photo courtesy of Asia Newson)', 'As it turns out, the security guards had been telling Gilbert about the young kids selling candles downtown. His response: one of curiosity, and admiration at their hustle. Instead of asking her to leave his properties, Gilbert invited Newson to meet with him at his office. She did. And at that moment, she explains, he said I have keys to the city, and I can sell anywhere!', 'Grateful, she then turned her attention to building her business. She improved her packaging  enlisting the help of local Detroit watch, bicycle and lifestyle brand, Shinola. (She created that partnership simply by calling them up.) She began training more people. And she started getting calls from national media.', ""My website was just booming with orders. I was able to show everyone in my community, all of my friends, everyone in my school, how easy and how fun it was being an entrepreneur and having your own business. I was able to build my own dreams. I'm still doing it."", ""Newson's biggest goals, however, aren't just for herself. She believes in helping other kids  in Detroit and beyond  learn to be entrepreneurs. She wants to open a candle store in every US state.

Her message to all people: No matter what is going on in your life...no matter what other family responsibilities you have...no matter what your age, geography or gender, you can be a success. Just don't give up."", ""As a child, some adults try not to take you seriously, says Newson. You're going to go through so many things, especially with being  entrepreneur. People think it's easy, but it's not. You're going to go through so many things, but you have to never give up. You can't give up because you're a child. And you can't be afraid to fail.

There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report.', 'The number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015.

He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.”', 'Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims.', 'Both as a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has used Twitter and speeches to attack an ever-growing list of targets that number in the hundreds. He has sometimes posted images and messages of support on Twitter that appeared to be anti-Semitic or the work of white nationalists, as have his advisers.', 'Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme. He has often pointed out that his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are Orthodox Jews, and when asked about his support among white nationalist groups in an interview with The New York Times last November, he said, “I disavow and condemn” them.', 'The Southern Poverty Law Center said its report tracked only groups that engage in activities in the real world, like passing out leaflets, holding rallies or distributing membership cards. But it warned that such an approach could play down the true reach of extremism because many extremists operate primarily on social media and other online forums.', '“We make a mighty effort to separate out what is really just some guy with a web page or a web forum or tweeting,” Mr. Potok said in an interview. “They have to do something that happens in the real world as opposed to online.”', 'He said the drop in far-right groups might also reflect that they have less to offer members in an age when similar rhetoric can be heard at a political rally. “They can find just as much anti-government vitriol expressed at a Trump rally and be part of a bigger, more exciting movement,” he said.', 'The rise in the number of anti-Muslim groups mirrored the 67 percent surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes reported by the F.B.I. in 2015, the last year for which the agency has statistics. There were 257 anti-Muslim episodes reported to the police that year, the highest number since 2001, when more than 480 hate crimes were reported in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.', 'In the first 10 days after Mr. Trump’s election, the center said, it documented 867 bias incidents, including more than 300 that targeted immigrants or Muslims.', 'Hate crimes across the board appear to have become more common in recent years: In 2015, the F.B.I. said, there were 5,818 reported bias incidents against racial and religious minorities, gays and transgender people, and others, an increase of 6 percent from the year before.']"

How President Trump is — and is not — changing what it means to be American," A classroom in El Cajon, Calif., has changed radically in recent months as a result of the influx of refugees from","['EL CAJON, Calif. — Rhonda Fattohi gathered the children on the rug at the front of the classroom, a cluster of eager faces awaiting her next cue. By some stroke of luck, they had made it here, 20 third-, fourth- and fifth-graders whose families had escaped turmoil and hardship in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Mexico.', '“Who can tell me about your country? Starting with ‘Where I’m from,’ ” Fattohi asked, and tiny hands shot up.', '“Where I’m from, we play soccer,” one boy said. “Where I’m from, I like to eat biryani,” said another.', 'This is the so-called “newcomer” class, where Fattohi officially teaches English as a second language. Unofficially, she offers these children something much more profound: a vision of what it means to be an American.', 'That task has been complicated by the election of President Trump, who is seeking to reshape the American identity through strict limits on immigration. Trump’s assertion that some immigrants can’t — or won’t — assimilate into American society has left some immigrants here with the sense that it may not be possible for them to belong in a nation where many voters view Mexicans as violent criminals and the Muslim religion as fundamentally un-American.', 'A city of 104,000 just east of San Diego, El Cajon is home to one of the largest Arabic- and Chaldean-speaking populations in the country. Since the 1980s, the city has welcomed Chaldeans, members of Iraq’s Christian minority, who every Sunday pack the pews of three local churches, where services are conducted entirely in their native language.', 'In recent years, Muslim Iraqis have followed, along with refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere. On Main Street, so many shops bear Arabic signs that the city is often called “little Baghdad.” This school year alone, the Cajon Valley Union School District has absorbed 836 new foreign-born students, nearly a third of whom are Syrian refugees.', 'Among them are the children of Naema Hendawi, who, six months after arriving, is still grappling with the strangeness of this new place, and doubts about whether the family can succeed here. She and her husband, who is blind, are also alarmed by the high cost of living and the shortage of decent jobs. And they still can’t ask for directions, read signs or communicate while shopping in English, relying instead on their 14-year-old son to translate.', 'Hendawi wants her seven children to learn English, to get an education, to find jobs and to build their own families — things she feels certain would have been denied them in Syria. But on the Arabic-language satellite channels she watches, the news anchors constantly remind her of the precariousness of her position in a nation where “even American citizens” were stopped at the airports under Trump’s first stab at a travel ban on visitors from seven majority-Muslim nations.', 'Trump “hates Muslims,” Hendawi says. “He wants to send all the Muslims back.”', 'Rosa Munoz, a local nurse and a native-born American, lives with Jose Luis Vernal, a Mexican citizen. Trump’s rhetoric has made their city feel less welcoming, they said, and Vernal finds himself happier when the family spends weekends at their second home in Tijuana.', 'Vernal and Munoz — who have long used the word “American” to mean white — said that, even before Trump’s election, they felt that Americans do not always treat them as equals.', 'Amir Bajelori, who arrived in El Cajon 20 years ago, takes a practical approach when he counsels his growing flock of Syrian and Iraqi refugees who pray at the Kurdish Community Islamic Center.', '“You can practice your religion here, but some other things that you do at home [in Iraq or Syria] are not allowed here,” he said he told them during a recent sermon, “like raising your voice, putting too many kids in a car, driving without a license.”', 'Some of the new arrivals are offended to see American women wearing revealing clothing or are upset by the presence of dogs in their apartment buildings, animals often considered unclean by practicing Muslims. But he tells them to deal with it.', '“You have to respect them,” Bajelori says; in America, people have the right to be different.', 'In the center of El Cajon at Anza Elementary, Fattohi, 41, delivers a similar message. On the sunny campus of garden plots and science projects, 70 percent of the students speak a language other than English at home.', 'For two hours a day, five days a week, Fattohi teaches the new arrivals reading, writing, speaking and phonics (“In English, we don’t pronounce all the letters,” she reminds them), but also the importance of showing up on time for appointments, wearing seat belts and not calling people fat.', 'On a recent afternoon, Fattohi held up a picture of two girls studying a book together. “Where is Yasmin from and what language does she speak?” she asked her class.', '“Iran!” a boy volunteered. “Farsi!” said another.', 'Each day that week, they had talked about these fictional characters: Yasmin, a new Iranian student in a headscarf, and Olivia, an American with blonde hair. Yasmin gets bullied for wearing a headscarf, and Olivia learns to put herself in Yasmin’s shoes, feel her pain and comfort her.', '“When she puts herself in Yasmin’s shoes, what’s that called?” Fattohi asked.', '“Empathetic,” said Ahmad, a 9-year-old who had arrived the year before from Afghanistan. Once a reticent boy who had trouble following instructions, he has blossomed into one of Fattohi’s most enthusiastic students.', 'She hit play on the classroom speakers, and the children belted out a song: “Oh, empaaathyy! Means feeling what others feeeeel!”', 'Fattohi likes to tell her students where she’s from, and who she is. She wants them to know that you can struggle with English at first and still turn out okay; that you can maintain traditional values and love America; that you can eat biryani and still belong.', 'The daughter of Chaldean immigrants, she was born and raised in Detroit, socializing mostly with other Chaldeans at the local Chaldean club and Chaldean church. Fattohi’s father — who stayed involved in Iraqi politics as a political dissident abroad — at one point launched a Chaldean radio show.', 'The family later moved to a San Diego suburb without a large Iraqi community. There, Fattohi tells her students, that she realized at age 12 that she, too, spoke English with an accent. Her classmates in California made fun of her. She struggled for years with her sense of identity. She was embarrassed about her parents’ heritage, determined to fit in however she could.', 'Then the family moved to El Cajon, she says, and she finally felt that she belonged.', 'Today, Fattohi tries to impress upon her students that being an American starts with the kind of diversity found in her classroom, as well as a freedom of thought that is novel to many students from more homogenous nations.', '“I want them to take ownership. I want them to be proud of their roots and their heritage,” she says. “You don’t want them to forget that. You want them to fit in, but not blend in.”', 'Fattohi learned these things from her parents — model Americans, in her view. They still speak with Iraqi accents, cook traditional food and call their village in northern Iraq home. They raised their children to speak Chaldean. They also worked diligently, moved their family to more prosperous neighborhoods when they could, paid their taxes and cast ballots for American presidents. In November, her father — a conservative who yearns for the glory days of Detroit’s auto industry — voted for Trump.', '“You don’t have to love the president or the government or say the Pledge of Allegiance,” she said. “You need to do what you need to do to get by.”', 'Fattohi often reads challenging books with her students, even though they’re unable to understand all the words. On this day, it’s “Bedhead,” a book about a boy who wakes up with bad hair.', 'The words are difficult: “Milk was spilled, spit, and sputtered. And two toast toasties did triple back flips onto the breakfast table.” But Fattohi reads with such theatrics — her voice rising and falling, squealing and shouting — that the words don’t really matter.', 'She has every child’s attention as she demonstrates the bedhead hair going “up, down, around and around.”', 'Forty tiny hands flutter in pantomime, and 20 small voices rise in unison, singing the words along with her.']"

Even Wins\xa0said\xa0in a release that it had no idea what\xa0drove the surge in its stock, which boasts the best performance in the Nasdaq Composite Index over the past 12 months.', 'So how did a tiny Chinese company make it into the portfolios of U.S. retirees? And how did its biggest shareholder, Wang Hong, become a billionaire, at least on paper?', 'The mystery begins on the 37th floor of a shiny Times Square skyscraper. That’s where Wins’s U.S. headquarters are located, according to Securities and Exchange Commission\xa0filings. But there aren’t any signs of the business. Instead, the floor is occupied by Forefront Capital Advisors, a financial-services firm founded by\xa0Bradley Reifler, who used to be on the board of Wins.', ""Reifler, whose bronzed complexion matches his golden cuff links, is known on Wall Street for co-founding Pali Capital Inc., a brokerage that at its height was profitable enough, he said, to blow $4 million on a poker party with singer John Legend.

The bills, worth about $7 and $14 respectively, amount to 86% of their cash in circulation. India's 1.3 billion people get by with less than 200,000 ATMs in the country and 87% of transactions are cash."", ""Putting this in perspective for American readers, by the World Bank's definition, middle income Indians make between 680 and 3,400 rupees a day. The last time the U.S. faced a disruption of this size to its money supply was during the bank runs after the Great Crash of 1929."", ""This move won't cause India's banks to crash; people are rushing to exchange the soon to be worthless notes, and the banks don't have enough new notes to cover them, so their balances are swelling. But there is a downturn happening across the entire economy, as day to day activities decline due to the lack of liquidity needed to settle transactions.  What happens in a situation like this?  It turns out that many people look to commodities to hedge the risk of an economic slowdown; some people buy gold, others buy silver, but most interestingly, people buy Bitcoin."", 'I reached out to three pioneering Bitcoin startups in India to find out more about what is happening there.', "" Unocoin, India's Longest Running Bitcoin Service"", ""Sunny Ray heard about Bitcoin on Twitter back in 2012. Similar to my entrepreneurial path, he says he went into hibernation for six months, learning everything he could about the cryptocurrency. When he emerged he launched the country's first Bitcoin MeetUp. People would show up with bags of cash to purchase Bitcoin, which was exciting, but also inefficient and unsafe. Ray connected with Sathvik Vishwanath via the MeetUp and three years ago they launched Unocoin. The company fills a role in India similar to what Coinbase does here in the U.S., providing wallets and acting as a point of sale system."", "" BTCXIndia, India's Largest Bitcoin Exchange"", 'Kamesh Mupparaju first thought about creating a remittance service, but then determined that running an exchange was where he wanted to be - the settlement partner in India is how this CEO describes BTCXIndia. They were doing 10 BTC a day at the start back in 2014 and since the demonetization their volume has increased tenfold.', "" Zebpay, India's Largest Mobile Bitcoin Service"", 'Sandeep Goenka of Zebpay says that he and his two co-founders sought to make Bitcoin as simple as instant messaging for the average user. Launched in July of 2016, one fifth of their 250,000 users came aboard in the month of November. Not just a Bitcoin to rupee bridge, users can top off their cell phone minutes and data plans, pay for their home communication services, and other businesses are rushing to connect to the service.', ""You can't understand how Bitcoin may progress in India without understanding the role gold plays in their society. An American couple's most valuable asset is typically their home, their social standing is based on their neighborhood, their income, and their education. An Indian couple's possession of gold touches on all of these areas. Bitcoin fans in the west offer comparisons to gold, seeing both as a liquid commodity. Digital currencies in India will straddle the line between fiat and precious metals, valued for transactions, but lacking the cultural weight that gold carries."", ""Demonetization has obviously been a major event for all three companies, but each has experienced it from their own perspective. Service oriented Zebpay has seen a spike in interest, but didn't seem all that affected by the price changes. Unocoin saw a price rise of 20% while BTCXIndia saw a rise of up to 40%. Countries like China and the U.S., with large, liquid Bitcoin markets, can lead the global price. When a smaller market experiences a big change it doesn't trigger a global effect, and it creates arbitrage opportunities."", ""My company, Bitwage, benefitted directly from the situation. 60% of our site's Indian visitors for the year turned up in one big burst in mid-November and many signed up for our service. Using our Bitcoin based international payroll service meant our customers were getting about 80 rupees for every dollar they earned, while those using the legacy banking system only got about 68.5."", 'Six weeks after the November 8th announcement the initial frenzy is over and Indian BTC prices are just 5% above the global norm. I asked about the overall outlook and Ray provided this concise assessment:', ""The real impact of this will be long term. The initial growth is mainly because there is a cash crunch. Once the demonetization situation settles down, people aren't going to rush towards a new experimental currency, they are going to go buy milk. But they will ask themselves, 'What is money, what makes it good or bad?'. People are starting to learn more about Bitcoin as a result. "", ""Prime Minister Modi's top secret move to demonetize large bills was rooted in a desire to thwart counterfeiting, money laundering, tax dodging, and terrorism funding. The urge for the estimated $45 billion dollar payday for the Reserve Bank of India, expected in the form of 'black money' that would be written off rather than laundered, was also a factor. Preliminary numbers indicate almost all of the cash will get converted and speculation suggests all that Modi accomplished is a confirmation of the Indian cultural bias for holding gold as a store of value."", 'Supplies of the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes are making their way into circulation, but the larger bill is being received about as well as a $500 bill would be in the U.S. No store owner wants to wipe out their limited supply of smaller bills and get stuck with a single large bill in exchange.', ""While the long-term economic damage from this poorly executed policy is yet to be seen, the local bitcoin scene is sure to be emboldened from the fallout of these events. Two months ago Bitcoin was a tiny sliver of the Indian currency pie, and now that wedge is an order of magnitude larger and expanding. Bitcoin won't displace gold for the reasons cited above, but that 2,000 rupee note is a tempting target. ""]"
Investing In Water," Stocks and equities invested in water have been on the rise in recent months, and here is why.","['With political uncertainty soaring around the globe and most stock markets fully valued, investors need to make sure their portfolios include investments that will provide attractive returns over an extended period of time. Opportunities that benefit from demographic trends or from the increasing effects of climate change are particularly attractive to investors with a long time horizon.', ""Water scarcity is a global theme that combines demographics and climate change. There is no substitute for water. As the world's population continues to grow and becomes wealthier, demand for water is rising fast. According to the UN, by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under water stress. From human consumption to industrial and agricultural use, global demand for water and water services are expected to outpace current supply. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests that there will be a 40% gap between water demand and supply over the next 15 years. Agriculture is the largest user of water (70%), followed by industry (20%) and individuals (10%). Every person drinks 2-4 liters of water a day and eats 2,000-5,000 liters of virtual water in the food they consume."", 'There are opportunities to invest in water scarcity in both emerging markets and the U.S. In China, 80% of rivers are too toxic for fish, let along human consumption. In its twelfth Five Year Plan, the Chinese government allocated about $110 billion per year to environmental protection and pollution control, including wastewater and solid waste treatment. A similar or higher amount will be needed in the next five-year plan to address continued water scarcity issues.', ' Water in the preliminary stages of recycling at the West Basin Municipal Water District water recycling facility in El Segundo, California, September 14, 2015. ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images', 'The U.S. will also require significant investment in water treatment and transportation in the near future. For example, the poor infrastructure that caused lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan is not an anomaly. In California, governments are spending about $20 billion annually on their water supply, a number that is also expected to increase. Investments are needed along the entire water-value chain, and global water-infrastructure projects alone are expected to see annual growth of 5%-8% according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', 'Companies that focus on addressing the increasing demand for and limited supply of water may represent some of the best growth opportunities for investors. While water itself is not (yet) a traded commodity, you can invest in companies that derive revenue from this limited resource in three ways:', 'Expanding the water supply. Exploration, desalination and wastewater treatment plants are developing new water infrastructure and creating sustainable and reliable supply systems.', ' tIncreasing current water efficiency. Companies that are developing improved irrigation, leakage detection and smart meters are creating effective solutions for reducing demand and promoting sustainable use of available resources.', ' tImproving water quality and treatment facilities. This includes companies that are developing cutting-edge filtration technologies and disinfection chemicals.', 'Many firms are pursuing these opportunities, including utilities, manufacturing and technology companies. For example, Danaher Corporation is a leader in water quality analysis and treatment systems. Danaher provides instrumentation and disinfection systems to help analyze and manage the quality of water in residential, commercial and industrial applications. Xylem is a global water technology provider with a diversified line of energy efficient water pumps.

"The $4,500 injection to stop heroin overdoses"," Drug price spikes have become an annual, if rather familiar, debate across American medicine land.","['First came Martin Shkreli, the brash young pharmaceutical entrepreneur who raised the price for an AIDS treatment by 5,000\xa0percent. Then, Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, who oversaw the price hike for its signature EpiPen to more than $600 for a twin-pack, though its active ingredient costs pennies by comparison.', 'Now a small company in Richmond called Kaleo Pharma is joining their ranks. It makes an injector device that is suddenly in demand because of the nation’s epidemic use of opioids, a class of drugs that includes heavy painkillers and heroin.', 'Called Evzio, it is used to deliver naloxone, a life-saving antidote to overdoses of opioids. More than 33,000 people are said to have died from such overdoses in 2015. And as demand for Kaleo’s product has grown, the privately held firm has raised its twin-pack price to $4,500, from $690 in 2014.', 'Founded by twin brothers Eric and Evan Edwards, 36, the company first sought to develop an EpiPen competitor, thanks to their own food allergies. Now, they’ve taken that model and marketed it for a major public health crisis. It’s another auto-injector that delivers an inexpensive medicine.', 'One difference, though, is that Evzio talks users through the process as they inject naloxone. The company says the talking device is worth the price because it can guide anyone to jab an overdose victim correctly, leave the needle in for the right amount of time and potentially save his or her life.', 'According to Food and Drug Administration estimates, the Kaleo product, which won federal approval in 2014, accounted for nearly 20\xa0percent of the naloxone dispensed through retail outlets between 2015 and 2016, and for nearly half of all naloxone products prescribed to patients between ages 40 and 64 — the group that comprises the bulk of naloxone users.', 'And the cost of generic, injectable naloxone — which has been on the market since 1971 — has been climbing. A 10-milliliter vial sold by one of the dominant vendors costs close to $150, more than double its price from even a few years ago, and far beyond the production costs of the naloxone chemical, researchers say. The other common injectable, which comes in a smaller but more potent dose, costs closer to $40, still about double its 2009 cost.', 'Still, experts say the device’s price surge is way out of step with production costs and a needless drain on health-care resources.', '“There’s absolutely nothing that warrants them charging what they’re charging,” said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University in Boston.', 'Kaleo, which is trying to blunt the pricing backlash and turn Evzio into the trusted brand, is dispensing its device for free — to cities, first responders and drug-treatment programs. Such donations were also essential to the EpiPen’s business strategy.', 'The device has been invaluable to patients, said Eliza Wheeler of San Francisco’s Harm Reduction Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works to combat overdoses and has received donations of Evzio. But at $4,500 a package?', '“I might have $10,000 to spend on naloxone for a year to supply a whole city,” Wheeler said. “If I have 10 grand to spend, I certainly can’t buy two Evzios.”', 'Mark Herzog, Kaleo’s vice president of corporate affairs, said in an email that most earlier naloxone devices were “developed, designed and intended” for use in medically supervised settings.', 'Prior kits contained a pre-filled syringe. The Evzio was the first to help nonprofessionals dispense the drug. And competition is limited: One of the few consumer-friendly alternatives to Evzio is a nasal-spray device for naloxone.', 'The opioid crisis has led more experts to call for expanded access to naloxone — for people navigating addiction and for those around them. The idea is that if someone nearby could overdose, dispensing the drug should be as easy as pulling the fire alarm.', 'Federal and state governments have spent millions of dollars equipping police officers and other first responders with naloxone. In communities particularly hard-hit by drug overdoses, places such as schools, libraries and coffee shops are keeping the antidote on hand. Physicians are prescribing it to patients who are taking prescription painkillers in an effort to make sure they — and their families and friends — are prepared.', 'The Evzio could be ideal, especially when medical professionals are not nearby, noted Traci Green, an associate professor at Boston University’s School of Medicine. But the price limits access.', '“It’s a really good product,” she said. “It’s elegant. People do like it — but they can’t afford it.”', '“There’s a lot of value to this formulation,” said Ravi Gupta, a medical student and lead author of a December op-ed on the pricing issue, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “But it’s not justified. This pricing is not justified.”', 'But consumers may not yet be pinched. In another Mylan parallel, Kaleo offers coupons to patients with private insurance, so they don’t have any co-pay when they pick up the device.', 'So Kaleo would say the price hikes are essentially moot. Herzog said they are necessary to subsidize programs that do not offer co-payments. In a follow-up email, he added that the list price is “not a true gauge,” because insurance companies can sometimes negotiate rebates and discounts. And, he said, since the price increase, more patients have gotten Evzio prescriptions filled — so the cost doesn’t seem to be stopping them.', 'Mylan provides a similar EpiPen discount — a move that’s helped cement it as the dominant epinephrine provider. But even if consumers don’t directly pay for the price increases, they’re affected, analysts cautioned.', '“When you have these kinds of programs, the cost is still borne by patients, because insurance premiums go up,” Beletsky said.', 'That, analysts say, undermines Kaleo’s argument that they’re somehow increasing access. After all, while some government agencies and private organizations get the drug for free or at a deep discount, that isn’t true across the board. For those who don’t get that deal, the list price matters.', 'Take Vermont. The state’s been particularly hard-hit by the epidemic — more than 70 people died of opioid overdose in 2015, and it’s been dubbed America’s “heroin capital.”', 'Its health department is trying to get naloxone into the hands of people using opioids, setting up distribution sites around the state. But because of its high cost, Evzio isn’t an option, said Chris Bell, who runs the state health department’s emergency preparedness and injury prevention division. So it is opting for the nasal spray that costs a fraction of the price.', 'That’s not true everywhere, though. The Veterans Health Administration, known for its especially high rate of patients taking opioid-based prescription painkillers, covers the auto-injector. It can do so, though, because of its bargaining power — the agency is legally authorized to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies.', 'As a result, Veterans Affairs is paying “far, far less” than the Evzio list price, said Joseph Canzolino, deputy chief consultant for pharmaceutical benefits management at VA. (He would not release the precise figure.)', 'The agency’s buying power is such, he added, that even when companies drive up prices, what VA pays will stay more or less stable — far below a figure he called “pretty exorbitant.”', 'Thanks to an infusion of public funding to combat opioid overdoses, other institutional buyers may also be able to afford Evzios. Their budgets are larger right now, so they’re less price sensitive, said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School.', 'But that money comes from somewhere — most probably taxpayers. And it’s hardly sustainable, Price noted, saying “at some point in time, the rubber’s got to hit the road.”', 'Kaleo has given away more than 180,000 devices, Herzog said, distributed in 34 states among about 250 organizations such as police departments and nonprofit groups that distribute naloxone to people at risk of overdose.', 'Advocates and pharmacy groups have made videos touting the product. In neighborhoods where overdose is common, businesses — such as fast-food restaurants, grocery stores and other retail establishments — are interested in keeping readily dispensable naloxone on hand.', 'But those who’ve accepted free Evzio devices and have come to rely on it may soon face withdrawal.

Revived GOP health care talks could hurt those with pre-existing conditions, BBC health correspondent sums up the concerns of those fighting Obamacare repeal on Twitter.!.,"['The renewed GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare could be bad news for those with pre-existing conditions.', 'The proposal under discussion among conservative House Freedom Caucus members and the White House would allow states to opt out of two key Affordable Care Act provisions: essential health benefits, which require insurers to cover certain services, and community rating, which bars carriers from charging consumers based on their medical history or gender.', ""Eliminating these federal requirements could greatly erode the safeguards Obamacare put in place for those with pre-existing conditions, violating President Trump and Republicans' repeated promises to protect these folks. It would leave many enrollees -- particularly sicker ones -- on the financial hook for much more of their care."", 'Also, it would allow insurers to effectively cherry-pick the people they want to cover.', 'Related: Health care talks intensify, but no proof of any changed minds', ""Here's what would likely happen:"", 'The essential health benefits provision requires all insurers to cover 10 services, including maternity care, substance abuse treatment and prescription drugs, in all plans sold on the individual market.', ""Without the measure, insurers could offer cheaper plans that don't cover as much. They would not have to pay for costly benefits, such as mental health services or even hospitalization. They could also opt not to cover the treatments needed by patients with costly illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes and hepatitis C."", ""That would work out well for young and healthy people who don't go to the doctor much. They could buy skimpy plans with low premiums."", ""But it wouldn't be so good for those who need care. They would have to shell out for all the services that their insurance policy doesn't cover. And they wouldn't be shielded by Obamacare's financial protections -- such as the annual limit on deductibles and co-pays -- since those would only apply to covered benefits."", ""Getting rid of the community rating provision would once again let carriers base their premiums on an enrollee's health or gender. Again, healthy people would benefit from lower rates."", 'But sick people could be charged sky-high premiums commensurate with how much their treatments cost, leaving some unable to afford coverage. And young women might have to pay more since they typically use more health care services and could become pregnant.', 'Related: Before Obamacare, some liked their health care plans better', ""In the final hours before the GOP bill collapsed last month, the Freedom Caucus convinced Republican leaders to weaken Obamacare's essential health benefits' measure, leaving it to the states to determine what services should be covered. But this move spooked moderate Republicans, who were concerned it would leave their constituents with less care and bigger bills, and led to the bill being shelved. The current discussions underway haven't healed any of those divisions.""]"
I’ve worn ash on my head on ESPN for 16 years. This year was different.," After 19 years on national television, I’m changing ways with the Ash Wednesday tradition of wearing an ash on television (","['I guess I’m giving up silence for Lent this year.', 'That’s an odd thing to say when you make a living yapping about sports on ESPN. And odder when the show I host, “Around the Horn,” makes a game out of LOUD NOISES. (That is to say, loud, perspicacious noises from the most insightful sportswriters in America!) I press a mute button to shut them down if (when!) our sports debate careens out of bounds (Fake News!). Silence is how I penalize. Silence works. But is silence good?', 'I’ve been on national television for 16 years and for all 16 I wore an ash on Ash Wednesday. I am grateful to ESPN and fortunate to work in an environment that allows me to be myself. But it’s shocking to me that I’m one of the few faces you see on TV wearing an ash. I did an interview where the reporter told me if you put “The Guy Who Wears Ashes on TV” into Google, I’m the first name that comes up. That’s surprising. (Also true: I’m the first name that comes up for “The Guy Who Proposed In Between The Men’s and Women’s Bathroom at LaGuardia Airport.” Not as surprising.)', 'Among ESPN viewers, it’s well known I’ll be wearing the ash and there’s an expectation. I’m not sure how I feel about that. Sports websites have kept a running tally of my ash through the years. ‘How Heavy Thumbed Will Fr. Mario Be This Season?!’ I see the humor in that; I was tattooed in ‘06, crop dusted in ‘09, this year: “clean, minimal, very on trend for 2017,” according to one tweeter. While I get questions like: “dad n em wana kno wats on ur coconut man,” the overwhelming energy has always been support and praise.', 'I struggle with the publicness of the ash. I was rolling in the pew laughing (RIPL!) when this year’s Gospel started with “Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them.” Isn’t that what I’m doing when I get the ash in the afternoon and go on TV a few hours later? Could I not go to Mass after work? I’m still not sure I have answers to those questions. I want viewers to see an authentic version of me, and on this one day that includes the ash.', 'Which brings me back to silence. A thought at this moment: I do it publicly one day, think about those who are questioned about their faith every day. Those who are demanded to answer for their faith every day. Those who are threatened because of their faith every day. Or more to the point, think of those whose beliefs and life are prejudged and silenced every day because their ash is a hijab or turban or yarmulke or a passport that has a foreign birth country.', 'If the Christian Brothers and Jesuits taught me anything, it’s that you can’t have apprehension without challenging your beliefs. Educate, question, challenge, re-educate, re-question, re-challenge. If that’s true for one’s personal faith, isn’t it also true of capital F, Faith? Isn’t that what Pope Francis is doing right now? He’s opened a window and let fresh air into a room.', 'My church experience began pretty conventionally and fitting for someone named Anthony Joseph Paul Reali. (Can’t you just see the white suit at First Holy Communion?) Church every Sunday. Knights of Columbus free-throw-shooting contests. There was St. Charles in Staten Island, St. Gabriel’s in New Jersey, Christian Brothers Academy and Fordham University. Growing up in the church in the ‘80s meant a lot of “Here I Am, Lord.”', 'When I was based in Washington, D.C., for “Pardon the Interruption” and “Around the Horn,” I became a parishioner at a church that changed me forever: St. Augustine’s in Northwest D.C. “The Mother Church of Black Catholics” was a jaw-dropping experience for me. A spirituality vortex! The music. The homilies.', 'Fr. Pat and Fr. Paul spent Sunday after Sunday talking about being Catholic today, right now, this second. They talked about being a Catholic whose feet were on the street — “Feet On The Street” — being the community outreach group to homeless people. They talked about Trayvon Martin and whatever else was in the news. I was in a church that was so current, a parish that put its heart outside of its body for all to see. I can’t imagine there’s a parish anywhere with more voice.', 'Realizing faith and spirituality can have that type of current voice is a powerful thing when you consider where we are in the world today. The Catholic Church is no different from\xa0any other world religion in the constant need for fresh air. I’d consider it a necessary challenge for all religions and value systems: How do you re-evaluate and remain open-minded as the world thankfully progresses? What happens if it feels like the world isn’t progressing the way it should?', 'Trying to answer that last question is like hugging smoke. But I think I know how I want my answer to start: by not being silent. Change starts with voices. Those voices might be sparked by anger — maybe we have to allow for that — but they can’t only be anger. What if the voice comes from empathy? What if the way to move forward is by staying engaged with other people and putting our feet on the street? What if we saw people as the human beings they are, not the scarf on their head, country on the passport, or ash on their face? These are the questions I find I’m asking myself. Questions that should not be silenced.', 'Tony Reali is the host of the ESPN program, “Around the Horn.” It airs weeknights at 5 p.m. (EST).']"

10 Artists to Watch in 2017, Music on the rise: the hottest names on the new wave soundtrack.,"['More', 'The year 2017 hasn’t even started yet. Yet, over the past few months, a clutch of fledgling stars have released singles and EPs that promise great things for their full debuts, coming in the new\xa0year. Here are Yahoo Music’s recommendations.', 'CLOVES', 'Singers needn’t shout to show their skills. Fresh proof arrived on Cloves’s understated EP, XII, which teases her forthcoming full release. The 19-year-old, born Kaity Dunstan, never raises her voice above a conversational level when she sings. Yet the agility of her phrasing, and her command of multiple octaves, will make your head spin. Cloves took her name after making a trip to Bali, where that herb serves as the national symbol. For her initial recordings, Cloves worked with producers Justin Parker (Lana Del Rey, Sia) and Rich Cooper (Mumford &\xa0Sons). But she’s a more subtle singer than any of those stars. Employing just a light piano, a flicker of acoustic guitar, and the occasional drum beat, Cloves spirals around her melodies with a graceful ache. Her song “Don’t Forget About Me” highlighted the soundtrack for Me Before You, setting the bar high for that debut.', 'VAGABON', 'Who doesn’t welcome a well-turned underdog story? In “The Embers,” the opening track off Vagabon’s mesmerizing debut, she sings with equal parts delicacy and determination about feeling “so small/my feet can barely touch the floor/on the bus where everybody is tall.” In “Fear and Force,” she expresses her alienation with a pained authority. Her outsider perspective reflects something tangible. The woman who performs under the name Vagabon was born Letitia Tamko in Cameroon, Africa. As a teen, she came to her current home in New York, creating the kind of culture shock that’s manna for any artist seeking a fresh eye on the world. The music Vagabon makes, which mixes synths, guitars, and drums, draws on scores of indie-rock influences. There’s a hint of the Velvet Underground in “Fear and Force,” and suggestions of the Replacements in “Minneapolis.” You’ll find both cuts on her debut, which arrives Feb. 24 on Father/Daughter Records. Given Tamko’s discomfort with life’s limitations, it’s telling the title she chose: Infinite Worlds.', 'ROB\xa0$TONE', 'Whistling may be a common motif in pop hits — from the old chestnuts of Perry Como to Otis Redding’s “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay” to Guns N’ Roses’ “Patience.” But rarely has that puckered sound eaten up as much of a single as it does in Rob $tone’s breakout song “Chill Bill.” (He sampled the whistling from the Kill Bill Vol. 1 soundtrack.) Allegedly written by $tone in the back of a police car during an aborted arrest, “Chill” laces its central hook around a deep bass intonation, punctuating the star’s lolling raps. To mirror its weed-friendly lyrics, $tone’s flow has a blissed-out ease. The 21-year-old, who was born Jaylen Robinson, grew up in the less-moneyed part of San Diego. There he bonded with a local group of rappers known as the 1207 Collective. Together they’ve been opening shows for A$AP Ferg of late. Meanwhile, “Chill” has earned more than 150 million streams on Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud, helping shoot it to No. 29 on the Billboard Hot\xa0100. All this has built major buzz for $tone’s major-label debut, arriving this spring. With so much juice behind a novelty single, $tone could well become the Fetty Wap of 2017.', 'MAGGIE ROGERS', 'Time’s passage plays a key role in the songs of Maggie Rogers. The theme informs both of her tantalizing singles, “Alaska” and “Dog Years.” In each, Rogers harmonizes with herself, creating dense solo chorales. The result has gained significant traction. Rogers’s first single, “Alaska,” has been streamed more than 21 million times. She road-tested the song in front of no less impressive a mentor than Pharrell Williams, when he was teaching a master class at the Clive Davis Institute at NYU, which Rogers attended. The strength of the song bagged the singer a deal with Capitol Records, which issued a beguiling follow-up, “Dog Years.” Both songs will be featured on a hotly anticipated release, arriving in February.', 'SUSTO', 'Their unusual name comes from a Latin American term for “panic attack.” But the music of SUSTO tempers the roiling emotions in their lyrics with a mellifluous twist on alterna-country. In songs like “Hard Drugs” and\xa0“Gay in the South,” SUSTO tell the tales of souls in conflict, both with themselves and their surroundings. Leader Justin Osborne formed the five-person band in his native Charleston, S.C. After releasing music independently, they crafted a haunting album called I’m Fine Today, set to debut on Caroline Records Jan. 13. It’s highlighted by Osborne’s vulnerable vocals and hummable melodies. By February, more listeners will discover SUSTO when they open shows for the Lumineers.', 'KHALID', 'The guitar tickles, the beat strokes, and the voice warms the song to its core. Every sound in “Location,” the first single by Khalid, burns with romantic need. The lyrics — which are well-tuned to the logistics of the digital age — surely didn’t hurt in gaining attention. So far, “Location” has earned nearly 1 million views on YouTube, not bad for a debut song by someone just 18 years old. Born in El Paso, Texas, Khalid cut his first single while still in high school. But his voice has a gentlemanly maturity, inspiring RCA to sign him in\xa02016. Another song Khalid recorded, “Hopeless,” floats on one of the most insouciant R&B/pop melodies in memory. There’s a formality to his tunes that contrasts the arty style of Frank Ocean or the droning one of Drake. When Khalid’s first full album appears, it could prove both a critical and commercial smash.', 'FRANCES', 'Love needs assurance, a desire the singer Frances taps into on her arresting first single, “Say It Again.” In this ravishing ballad, the U.K. singer begs a lover to restate his feelings for a sad reason. Since she had never known love before, she can’t believe it’s real. However needy that may sound, Frances makes her pining irresistible. The clear-voiced 26-year-old singer (born Sophie Frances Cooke, in Oxford, England) received her musical training at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. In 2014, she signed with the prestigious Communion Records, which released two EPs, leading to her nomination for the BBC “Sound of 2016” prize. Frances’s first full American release, Things I’ve Never Said, will arrive on Capitol Records this March. It contains “Say,” along with songs that combine classic pop and R&B, delivered by a voice shivering with sincerity.', 'THE ACCIDENTALS', 'Meet Americana’s next big thing. The Accidentals, led by Savannah Buist and Katie Larson, hail from Michigan, a state that inspired in them an ode catchy enough to serve as its own tourist draw, “Michigan and Again.” Like all the group’s songs, it boasts a finely observed lyric and a brightly catchy tune. Musically, their songs sift together folk, bluegrass, alt-rock, and even classical music, via the somber tones of Larson’s cello. The Accidentals match their instruments to girlishly high voices that can sound both winsome and wise. The core duo began performing four years ago while still in high school. They’ve been prolific since, recording loads of indie releases, filming well-shot videos, while earning Billboard’s nod as one of the breakout groups at 2015’s South by Southwest. They’ve opened national tours for the likes of Andrew Bird, Brandi Carlile, and Dar Williams. This coming spring, they’ll finally issue their major-label debut for Sony.', 'GONE IS GONE', 'Fans of avant-metal have a lot to look forward to. A new supergroup, comprising members of Mastodon, At the Drive-In, and Queens of the Stone Age, will release their first full album in 2017. The quartet formed early this year, instigated by Drive-In’s Tony Hajjar, who’d been matching his punishing beats to the sounds of guitarist-keyboardist Mike Zarin on video game scores. Looking to flesh their sound out, they partnered with bassist Troy Sanders (who doubles as Mastodon’s howler) and super-heavy QOTSA guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen. In June, the newly minted foursome issued an EP whose concussive riffs, thunderous beats, and vengeful vocals inspired enough material for the full album coming in January.', 'MUNA', 'In the bold new single by the women of MUNA, they amplify every feeling they’ve been told to repress. “Every time I don’t shut up/it’s a revolution,” declares singer Katie Gavin as the rousing melody cheers her on. Small wonder they titled the song “Loudspeaker,” boldfacing the theme of self-assertion that highlights the trio’s debut album, which arrives Feb. 3. MUNA comprises three L.A.-based musicians, including keyboardist-guitarist Naomi McPherson and lead guitarist Josette Maskin, along with frontwoman Gavin. The group specializes in synth-driven indie rock, rooted in the Los Angeles sound of the ’80s. Like HAIM, MUNA must have spent a lot of time listening to Fleetwood Mac’s Mirage. The four-song EP they issued in the fall features a lush take on prime MTV-era synth-pop. Given that era, the theme of their single and their flair for hooks, “Loudspeaker” could become the “Voices Carry” of this generation.', '15 Shades of Grey: The Kinkiest Music Videos of All Time', ""24 Fearless Grammy Predictions: Who'll Win What?"", '24 Megahits That Shockingly Failed to Win Any Grammys', 'Lady Gaga Electrifies at Super Bowl LI', '‘Cash Me Ousside’ Girl Tells Dr. Phil That She Made Him Famous', ""Video Premiere: Andrew Joslyn Debuts 'Desiderata'"", 'Gallery: On the Scene at the 2017 NAMM Show', 'The 13 Unluckiest Musicians of All Time', 'Ohio State Student Who Vanished After Work Found Fatally Shot Near Park', 'Eres Tú - Carla Morrison', 'Maryland Mom Pleads Guilty in Beating Death of 9-Year-Old Son For Eating Piece of Birthday Cake', 'Nick Jonas and Nicki Minaj Team Up for Racy ‘Fifty Shades’ Track', 'Adam Levine Joined by Wife Behati and Daughter Dusty at Walk of Fame Ceremony: ‘I’m One of the Luckiest People’', 'What We’re Excited for and What We’ll Miss at the 2017 Grammys', ""Adam Levine's Daughter Dusty Rose Steals the Show at His Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony: Pics!"", 'The 10 Highest-Paid 2017 Grammy Nominees', 'Sofia Vergara Shares Old Bikini Pic From Her ‘Vergashian’ Days', 'Grammy Flashback Interview: Miranda Lambert', 'Kelsey and Camille Grammer’s Daughter Returns to NYFW', 'Lady Gaga Calls Bradley Cooper a ‘Ninja-Like Human Being’', ""‘Cash Me Outside’ Girl Returned To 'Dr. Phil'"", ""Video Premiere: Vintage Trouble Soundchecks 'Knock Me Out' as New Face of Fashion House Varvatos""]"

She visited a radiologist to get it checked.', '""He ended up doing five different biopsies, and on the last one, he pulled it out, and he looked at me, and his eyes welled up with water,"" Childs said.', '""It was definitely that out-of-body experience where you\'re kind of watching your own story play out, and as his eyes welled up, he said, \'I\'m not 100% sure, but if I had to bet, I\'m 99.9% sure what I just pulled out of your breast was breast cancer,\' "" Childs said.', 'Later on, once her diagnosis was confirmed, ""I needed to have surgery.""', 'Childs first opted to have a lumpectomy, in which only the cancerous mass in her breast was removed, but then the disease advanced. She was told that she would need another surgery. This time, she opted for a double mastectomy, in which both of her breasts -- even the one without cancer -- were removed.', '""I wanted to do a mastectomy on that right side, and then from there, you have to then contemplate, \'Well, should I do a prophylactic mastectomy on the other side that does not have cancer?\' "" Childs said. ""Many women have this thought, but I feel for a younger woman -- and I identify as a young survivor -- you have longer to live, therefore you have a greater chance of recurrence just by the mere fact that you\'re going to be alive longer.""', 'Since her cancer diagnosis, Childs has had nine surgeries to her chest. The double mastectomy was among the earliest.', ""Now, she is a healthy 43-year-old Milwaukee resident and a breast health advocate with Susan G. Komen of Southeast Wisconsin. While chemotherapy treatments affected Childs' fertility, she and her husband are preparing to adopt their first child, whom they can't wait to meet."", '""I am feeling wonderful. I can honestly say that my life is healthier, better directed after I\'ve had cancer,"" she said. ""It gave me a different lens to look through life.""', 'Yet because of her experience, Childs can relate to the 7% of women with breast cancer who are diagnosed before age 40, many of whom face the same decision she did: whether to go under the knife for a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.', ""'The cancer didn't develop overnight, so pump the brakes'"", 'Younger women with breast cancer are increasingly opting to undergo double mastectomies, even if they were diagnosed with early-stage cancer in only one breast, known as unilateral breast cancer, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Surgery on Wednesday.', 'The procedure to remove the healthy breast along with the affected breast is called a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, or CPM.', 'In certain states, more than 42% of women 20 to 44 who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2012 opted to remove both breasts with a CPM, the study found. Researchers now are hoping to determine why.', '""To be honest, I think it\'s very difficult to really pinpoint why the increase,"" said Ahmedin Jemal, vice president of surveillance and health services research at the American Cancer Society, who was senior author of the study. However, he offered some ideas.', '""One factor that could contribute to the increase is this desire for symmetry,"" Jemal said, referencing how the breasts would look more symmetrical after a double mastectomy compared with after having just one breast removed.', '""Another factor is probably the Angelina Jolie effect. She was diagnosed with the BRCA-1 cancer gene that mutation that causes breast cancer, and she had a double mastectomy, so that was covered widely in the media,"" he said. ""For women diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast, there is no evidence to suggest to remove the unaffected breast.""', 'Last year, the American Society of Breast Surgeons published a consensus statement in the journal Annals of Surgical Oncology recommending against the routine use of removing both breasts in women with unilateral breast cancer -- a recommendation that the American Board of Internal Medicine also made.', '""CPM should be discouraged for an average-risk woman with unilateral breast cancer. However, patient\'s values, goals, and preferences should be included to optimize shared decision making when discussing CPM. The final decision whether or not to proceed with CPM is a result of the balance between benefits and risks of CPM and patient preference,"" the statement said.', 'Even if a CPM procedure is to prevent cancer from developing in the healthy breast, Jemal said, ""the maximum is 6% of women will develop breast cancer on the unaffected breast within the next 10 years. It is very small.""', 'On the other hand, the most common second cancer in breast cancer survivors is another breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.', 'A healthy 55-year-old woman has about a 2.5% chance of developing invasive cancer in a given breast over the next 15 years, whereas a 55-year-old breast cancer survivor has a 10% to 15% chance, according to a paper published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2010.', 'About 12.4% of women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute.', '""Sometimes, surgery is a blessing, and it can help remove cancer and do great things, but it doesn\'t come cost-free, and it doesn\'t come complication-free,"" Childs, the breast cancer survivor, said.', '""There is going to be time that\'s needed to heal and recover, and if you\'re not willing to give yourself that time, maybe you should weigh that into your decision if it was lumpectomy versus mastectomy, but I think, do the homework. Don\'t rush into something so quickly. Take the time, get that extra opinion, meet with one more plastic surgeon,"" she said.', '""This is the best piece of advice I\'ve been told and I always share with other women: The cancer didn\'t develop overnight, so pump the brakes and take more time to make the best informed decision for you.""', 'Differences in mastectomies, by age', 'The new study included data on 1.2 million women 20 and older in the United States who were diagnosed with early-stage invasive unilateral breast cancer between 2004 and 2012. The data came from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.', 'The researchers took a close look at which patients in the data underwent a lumpectomy; a unilateral mastectomy, in which only the breast with cancer is removed; or a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.', 'A limitation, however, was that the researchers were unable to determine which patients may have been at a higher risk for a second cancer due to family history or genetic risk, as well as their socioeconomic status. Those factors are individually associated with the likeliness of receiving a CPM.', '""Genetic testing is more commonly performed in younger women with breast cancer, and genetic predispositions are more common,"" said Dr. Michael Sabel, a professor of surgical oncology and the chief of the division of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new study.', '""Many of these women may have had CPM because they harbor a genetic mutation, but I don\'t think the authors had that data,"" he said.', 'Among all the women in the study, 58.4% had a lumpectomy, 32.9% had only the breast with cancer removed, and 8.7% had both breasts removed.', 'The researchers found that the proportion of women opting for CPM declined with age. Only 2.4% of those 70 or older had both breasts removed, compared with 29.3% of those 20 to 29.', 'Nationally, the prevalence of CPMs also increased over time. Between 2004 and 2012, the number of women 45 and older who had both breasts removed jumped from 3.6% to 10.4%. For women 20 to 44, the number rose from 10.5% to 33.3%.', '""It is not surprising that younger women opt for CPM compared to older. The issue is what contributes to such a decision. This trend is multifactorial,"" said Dr. Francisco Esteva, a medical oncologist at NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new study.', '""For young women, they realize that they are at risk life long for a second cancer in the contralateral breast, and there is good data that the perception of this risk is greater than the real risk, but many women, with this knowledge, decide to make a definitive intervention,"" he said.', 'By the time many women come to their surgery, they may have undergone multiple studies and interventions, which can be overwhelming, Esteva said.', '""To consider ongoing higher-risk surveillance with mammograms, sonograms, possible breast MRIs, probable multiple biopsies, many benign, just becomes unacceptable and too stressful,"" he said. ""The women choosing bilateral mastectomy are choosing freedom from that.""', 'Sabel offered another idea. ""MRI is more commonly performed in younger women with denser breast tissue, and we know that MRI, being more sensitive, can lead to additional findings that lead women to opt for bilateral mastectomy,"" he said, but more research is needed.', '""Most of the literature shows a similar pattern, with CPM being strongly associated with decreasing age,"" he said. ""However, this still seems particularly high in those Midwestern states, and genetics or MRI wouldn\'t explain all of it.""', 'Indeed, the study also revealed regional differences in the rate of CPMs.', 'Where women are more likely to get healthy breasts removed', '""What we didn\'t expect was that we found the highest proportion in the Midwestern states, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado and South Dakota,"" Jemal said.', 'Those are the states in which more than 42% of women 20 to 44 who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2012 opted to remove both breasts with a CPM.', 'The study findings also showed significant increases in the percentage of women 20 to 44 who opted to receive CPMs between 2004 and 2006 compared with between 2010 and 2012, said Dr. Deborah Axelrod, a breast surgeon at the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York. She was not involved in the new study.', '""The numbers are staggering,"" Axelrod said.', '""In New York, for instance, which is where I practice, 11% of women in the early years had contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, which then rose to 28% in the later years,"" she said. ""It\'s really shocking to see that dramatic of an increase.""', 'The trend appeared to continue across the East Coast. Axelrod pointed to Virginia, where 9.8% of younger women underwent CPMs between 2004 and 2006 and 32.2% between 2010 and 2012. In Rhode Island, 7.6% rose to 25.8%, and in West Virginia, 6% rose to 26.4%.', 'In Wisconsin, where Childs, the breast cancer survivor, lives, 13.8% rose to 32.7%.', ""Axelrod added that she didn't think the increase could be explained on the basis of advances in developing better reconstructive techniques for mastectomies, since the rates of breast reconstruction advances did not seem to parallel the increase in mastectomies."", '""The study confirms several previous studies from single institutions and from large databases showing the increase in the use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomies,"" said the University of Michigan\'s Sabel.', '""The variability by states is very interesting and raises many questions,"" he said.', 'Double mastectomies tripled in 10 years', 'Sabel and his colleagues found in a separate study that the percentage of women who were eligible for lumpectomies but opted for double mastectomies rose between 2000 and 2012. The study was published in The Breast Journal last year.', 'Another study, published last year in the journal Annals of Surgery, found that the use of CPM overall more than tripled in the United States between 2002 and 2012, despite a lack of evidence that the procedure offers a survival benefit.', '""Further examination on how to optimally counsel women about surgical options is warranted,"" the authors of that study wrote.', 'Overall, Axelrod, the breast surgeon in New York, said that physicians should make more of an effort to have a balanced discussion with patients and try to dissuade them from removing a healthy breast without significant risk factors such as a BRCA gene mutation.', '""There is a responsibility on the part of physicians to explain to women what their options are and why it\'s not recommended to have the healthy breast removed, assuming that they\'re in the general pool of women with breast cancer and they don\'t have a mutation, and they don\'t have any other mitigating factors that we look at to say \'you are at an increased risk,\' "" Axelrod said.']"

The Guardian view on Christianity in Britain: neither here nor there, Lawyers representing the owners of a chain of Bible-publishing shops who refused to make a homophobic equality advert on the grounds of,"['Something very strange is going on. The chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission feels he must tell employers it is OK to celebrate Christmas, and that this will not offend unbelievers. The prime minister announces in parliament that of course people should be able to speak freely about their religious convictions. A\xa0thinktank argues that there should be a duty of “reasonable accommodation” to religious belief. All these are symptoms of a\xa0deep unease and confusion about the role of Christianity in British life.', 'Britain is a country with an established church in England and another national church in Scotland, a secular ruling class, and a population largely indifferent to distinctively Christian beliefs and overwhelmingly reluctant to go to church, which displays a growing hostility to the notion of “religion” at all. There are also significant religious minorities, primarily Muslim, who have their own arguments with secularism as well as with Christianity.', 'Some churches see their control of schools as a way back towards relevance, and the government is tempted by the idea that Christian-based schooling produces better results than the purely secular, even though the best research suggests that faith works in practice simply as a proxy for selection on the basis of class and parental wealth.', 'Much of the noise is based around the tendentious claim that conservative Christians who are prevented from discriminating against gay people are thereby discriminated against. The argument is hardly convincing. Although there were important issues of free speech involved in the case of Ashers bakery in Belfast, and in some other recent cases that did not come to court, Christians are not being persecuted if they are prevented from exercising their beliefs in ways that harm others. Neither are the followers of any other religion.', 'These prohibitions are not purely the imposition of secular law on religious believers. They are also the imposition of one kind of religious belief on another. There\xa0are people motivated by equally sincere and\xa0(theologically speaking) equally well-argued religious convictions on both sides\xa0of\xa0all these debates.', 'What is more, the conservative Christian case is fundamentally compromised when it is pitched in terms of “religious” freedom rather than what is actually meant, which is that the law of the land should follow specifically Christian principles. Religion is notoriously hard to define, as is secularism. Deciding which kinds of belief deserve special protection even if none are to be treated as theologically true turns out to be very complicated. Unfortunately it is also necessary. It is impossible to construct a nation or any community without shared moral values and practices, and surprisingly difficult to decide, as it were, from first principles, how to move these values beyond platitudes and into action. There is in some secularist discussions an unwarranted assumption that all real disagreement is political, whereas religious opinions are distinguished by being either platitudinous or false. In fact they can be inextricably tangled, and the religious aspect can make political disputes much harder to resolve.', 'Nervousness over Christmas is an absurd expression of a real void at the heart of soulless technocracy', 'And here the Christian critique has something to offer the rest of the country. There is a long tradition of religious thought about the development of virtues and values. The Christian version derives ultimately from Socrates and Aristotle, but those philosophers thought virtue was entirely compatible with slavery and infanticide, so it has been quite heavily modified since then. The central insight is that both individuals and societies, or social groups, develop their values by living them. Moral questions cannot be answered entirely by reasoning: we discover what kind of creatures we are by living; we develop virtues, like vices, by practising them. A compassionate society is one that treats its members compassionately,\xa0not one that makes speeches about the need to do so.', 'More subtly, the values of a society are developed and maintained by its institutions. These need not be branches of the state. In fact it’s essential that many of them aren’t. Trade unions, food banks, football leagues, even reading groups all qualify, but many will always be religious. It would be stupid and self-destructive to make such groups feel useless and unwanted. The nervousness over Christmas, or even over expressing religious belief, is an absurd expression of a real void at the heart of soulless technocracy.']"

But both stances may be incorrect: The FDA is showing a real appetite for change, and the agency is likely to benefit enormously from Gottlieb’s experience in the industry.', 'According to many on the right, the FDA is a “government bottleneck that imposes costs, delays, and uncertainties”; an agency that “delays approvals for therapies to search for remote risks”; and a place where “a culture of control strangles innovation.”', 'There’s more than an element of truth to this, as I painfully experienced in a previous role leading a drug development team. I often tangled with the FDA’s ultra-cautious regulators, who worried a lot about remote risks — and seemingly less about the patients who were suffering without an approved effective therapy.', 'But over the past five years, I’ve also seen what feels like the beginnings of a new FDA — an agency that seems authentically committed to accelerating innovation, embracing creativity and bluntly acknowledging the need to improve.', 'The first indication that the FDA might be on the right track came in 2013 in the form of an impassioned speech by Norman Stockbridge, director of the agency’s prestigious Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products. Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd at Stanford University, Stockbridge eschewed the anticipated bureaucratic banalities and dove right in, candidly highlighting concerns about the FDA’s “risk-aversion culture.” He emphasized the need to deal with false-positive safety signals more effectively to avoid negative consequences, such as delayed approvals and the reluctance of clinicians to use effective drugs that might have been unfairly impugned.', 'The new attitude seems to be taking hold: Many innovators working in digital health, for instance, now rave about their experience working with the agency, highlighting engagement with FDA leaders such as Courtney Lias, who directs the Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices, and Stacey Beck, who focuses on diabetes diagnostics. The FDA has also prioritized patient engagement through programs such as the Patient-Focused Drug Development Initiative, the Patient Representative Program and openFDA.', 'I’ve also witnessed this evolution. My current company (DNAnexus) partnered with the FDA in 2015 to develop a software platform called precisionFDA, which allows researchers to upload and share genome data with other scientists. \xa0The project — the brainchild of data scientist Taha Kass-Hout, who left the FDA last year — aims to build a research community that could improve the quality and accuracy of genome-based medicine.', 'The left, however, remains characteristically concerned that regulators will cozy up to the industry they are supposed to critically evaluate. They argue that Gottlieb’s lucrative relationship with the biopharma industry — as well as his lack of a university science background — makes him unsuitable for the position.', 'This critique reflects a surprisingly pervasive view within academia that both expertise and integrity are concentrated in universities and dissipate as you move further out.', 'For many in the academy, the true work of drug discovery is the journey from scientific inspiration to academic publication — a perspective that fails to appreciate the extraordinary effort required to go from the tenuous conclusion of a scientific journal article to a robust commercial product. This seems a bit like relying on a well-read virgin for advice on sex. There are some things you learn only by doing, and developing drugs is one of them.', 'As an investor in early-stage life-science companies, Gottlieb has presumably developed a hard-won, highly valuable understanding of the nuance of product development.

HP Inc.Voice: Three Ways To Reinvent For The Fourth Industrial Revolution, The CEO of Hewlett-Packard (HP) shares five years of his company's thinking on how the next 'Fourth,"['We are on the cusp of a new industrial revolution defined by the blending of our digital and physical worlds. At HP we call this Blended Reality, and we believe it will surpass the revolutions that came before in scale, scope and complexity. Connected factories, robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and 3D printing have the potential to disrupt and reinvent virtually every aspect of the $12 trillion manufacturing industry, unlocking unprecedented economic potential.  We estimate 3D printing will expand at a 30% compound annual growth rate to an $18 billion industry in 2021, with plastics being the largest portion of the market accounting for an estimated $10.4 billion. Even at $18 billion, that is a small fraction of the $12 trillion manufacturing industry.', 'Major tech companies like GE, SAP, and HP are investing heavily in 3D printing, working toward the shared vision of cost-effective, precision quality, mass personalization for everyone, everywhere. As with past industrial revolutions    water and steam to mechanize production, electricity to create mass production, electronics and IT to automate production   digital manufacturing will change how humans work, live and relate to one another. It will require transformation involving all stakeholders from the global community, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society.  All must adapt for the digital age.', 'Reinventing the Workforce', ""As we go through the fourth industrial revolution the global economy will undergo a major transformation.  The type and location of jobs will dramatically change.  According to the World Economic Forum, 65 percent of children today will grow up to work in jobs that don't exist yet, and almost 50 percent of the knowledge students acquire in the first year of a four-year technical degree will be outdated by the time they graduate. In past industrial revolutions we had the luxury of time to train and retrain workers. With the exponential rate of technological innovation, this is no longer the case."", 'Education institutions at all levels need to adopt an inclusive growth mindset that embraces change.  New curriculums are needed that teach technological literacy, equipping students with the skills needed to succeed in this new era of digitally computer assisted design and manufacturing. Programming, technology- and user-experience design, and equipment operation and management will be valued skills, along with cognitive abilities like creativity and logical reasoning.', ""This extends beyond the classroom. Needed skills will continue to evolve throughout a person's career. As more jobs are automated, employers must commit to providing their employees the tools and on-the-job access to learning that are necessary for future success."", 'Reinventing Trade & the Taxation of Goods', 'The taxation of goods and services is rooted in the physical movement of products. 3D printing disrupts this model. Instead of shipping tangible goods, companies will ship digital designs and raw materials, increasing production efficiency. Many products will be transported via digital files as ones and zeros, taking shape in a 3D printer at the destination. This shortens and localizes the supply chain while greatly reducing cross-border trade of goods.', 'The shift from trading physical goods to digital files could render existing WTO goods-related agreements irrelevant, raising questions like: Does the transmission of these files need to be classified as an import or export? If so, which country should be taxed? As value shifts to the end of the supply chain, the potential for supply chain taxes decreases. Governments will have to make up for lost revenue in new ways, and businesses may need to think about maintaining the raw materials they need closer to the point of manufacture.', 'Reinventing the Global Supply Chain & Sustainability', 'Traditional supply chains involve shipping components and products back and forth across the globe, leaving a trail of carbon emissions in their wake. The on-demand nature of the fourth industrial revolution through new technologies like additive manufacturing and immersive computing makes supply chains more efficient. Digitizing the shipment of goods and producing finished products nearer the point of consumption promises to reduce carbon emissions.  On demand production eliminates production waste and saves energy. This works only if the 3D ecosystem agrees to use sustainable materials and methods along the entire supply chain.', 'Every industrial revolution has required governments, businesses, and institutions to re-evaluate existing policies and procedures. The fourth industrial revolution is both different and the same, because it is both physical and digital. The global community must act quickly to keep pace with the unprecedented rate of technological innovation. All sectors of society must come together to ensure that our workforce, our economy, and our products are built for the new Blended Reality at the heart of Industry 4.0.']"

We threw it into the van and drove a couple of hours to the farm where we put the goat.""', 'Complications quickly arose. Exchange cadets at Navy who were accomplices were given 24 hours to reveal the location of the goat or face severe consequences. Parents then were enlisted to move the goat to a new hiding place on a farm in New Jersey. The ensuing investigation at West Point was no joke, and the intensity increased when it became obvious that the only route to escape would require lying. That was unacceptable to all involved.', 'The group hatched an alternative plan. The goat was secreted to West Point, and Russ, the Accomplice and others donned masks and rushed the goat into the massive mess hall and released it before scrambling away.', 'Almost immediately, they were busted and put on room restriction.', 'Their dressing down before the commandant would last an hour and a half. They were put on a ""boomerang,"" which meant no big Army-Navy weekend for them; they only would be bused to and from the game.', 'Said Russ, ""When you\'re a cadet, the game is your own version of Mardi Gras. It\'s a weekend of going nuts. It\'s a really cool weekend.""', ""They expected further punishment, including the potential delay of Russ' graduation."", 'As noted, however, they had carefully planned the operation, covering the contingencies, including getting caught. Even before stealing the goat, they made key political connections. The Accomplice even touched base with a family friend: Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.', ""The final months of 1990 were a tense time in the country. After years with no major military operation, the U.S. was facing down Saddam Hussein after he invaded Kuwait, an operation Schwarzkopf was heading. The Accomplice's connections helped him get a photo of the group and the stolen goat standing in front of a U.S. flag to Schwarzkopf."", '""We sent him a note that said, \'Hey, we hope this motivates the soldiers who are over there for Desert Shield,"" the Accomplice said. ""We are thinking and praying for everybody involved in the operation. Beat Navy!""', 'There also was plenty of back-channel, after-the-fact communicating among Army brass in support of the goat stealing, which Russ, the Accomplice and their friends helped promote.', '""We knew many high-ranking old grads put pressure on the commandant,"" Russ said. ""After dressing us down on how we missed every important lesson that they\'ve been trying to teach here, [the commandant] let us off at the last minute. It was surreal.""', 'The Accomplice recalled standing in the tunnel immediately before the 1990 game in Philadelphia. The West Point cadets took the field and then moved into the stands first. They were followed by the Midshipmen. A man ran to the Accomplice.', '""Some captain comes in and says, \'Hey, come here, you need to see this,"" he said. ""So we run out of the tunnel onto the field at Veterans Stadium with the whole brigade of Midshipmen standing at attention. The whole corps is on its feet chanting, \'We got your goat!\' It just was an amazing feeling. The corps knew, and Navy had to stand there and couldn\'t say a damn thing. That made a lot of it worth it.""', 'Not to mention Army won 30-20.', 'The Accomplice hastens to add that he never was directly told that Schwarzkopf intervened on their behalf. Still, during a spring visit to West Point after victory in the desert, Schwarzkopf invited the Accomplice to dine at his table in the West Point mess hall.', 'Said the Accomplice, ""In the middle of dinner, Schwarzkopf looks over at me and says, \'Hey, I really appreciate that picture you sent me of the goat. I hung it in the middle of my war room so all those admirals would have to look at it.\' Everybody kind of chuckled, but when I looked across at the commandant, he was not laughing.""', 'Russ did express one regret. A year later while he was in flight school after graduating, he received a dreadful bit of news. In a massive and impressively orchestrated 17-man operation, a crew from Navy successfully stole the Army mule for the first time in rivalry history two days before the game. Not only that, but they got all four mules: Spartacus, Traveller, Trooper and Ranger.', 'Navy, though 0-10 at the time, won 24-3.', 'Unlike Russ\' heist for West Point, Navy celebrated its theft, awarding a certificate to honor those who had stolen the mules, termed ""The Order of the Mule.""', ""The schools called a formal truce, which originated at the Pentagon, on mascot theft, but it didn't last. The Navy goat has been kidnapped four times since."", ""That being noted, the goat-nappings haven't helped Army's cause of late. When Russ and the Accomplice stole the goat, the all-time series was essentially tied. When Army and Navy meet Saturday, the Midshipmen will be seeking to extend a 14-game winning streak."", '""Cadets now don\'t even know what it\'s like to win -- it is frustrating,"" the Accomplice said. ""There is an element to beating your rival that is an integral part of being a cadet: this passion to come out on top, to beat your rival and prove you\'re better. So [14] years really stinks.""', 'Russ feels the same way, though his chosen terms are a bit more colorful -- and unprintable. Still, he takes solace that at his recent 25-year reunion, their goat-stealing operation received more than a few celebratory toasts.', 'Explained Russ: ""I was a pretty unremarkable cadet from every angle. And the thing I\'ll be most proud of and probably talk about until I\'m 6 feet under is, \'But me and my friends had the balls to steal the Navy goat.\' It\'s a weird thing.""']"
Marco Rubio Won’t Commit to Voting for Rex Tillerson , Here are highlights of the day's key stories:,"['■ Mr. Tillerson, the longtime chief of Exxon Mobil who had extensive business dealings in Russia, faced sharp questioning from Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, over his unwillingness to criticize President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.', '■ The record of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general, came under attack from Representative John Lewis and Senator Cory Booker.', '■ Elaine Chao had an easy glide in her hearing to be transportation secretary.', 'The nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, drew scrutiny over his business ties with Russia and said he would not call its president, Vladimir V. Putin, a war criminal. A protesters shouting, “Senators be brave!” was led from the chamber.', 'Though he has acknowledged that climate change exists, Mr. Tillerson said he did not view it as the imminent national security threat that some others did. He said some of the literature on the issue remained inconclusive — despite the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community about humans’ role.', 'Mr. Tillerson took an assertive stance early, but senators, notably Mr. Rubio, challenged him to call the actions of Mr. Putin’s military in Aleppo, Syria, a war crime. Mr. Tillerson declined to do so.', 'Mr. Rubio set off on an aggressive line of questioning, initially posing a simple query: “Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?”', '“I would not use that term,” Mr. Tillerson said.', 'Mr. Rubio, outlining a list of grievous Russian offenses in Syria, said he hoped Mr. Tillerson might adjust his answer.', '“Those are very, very serious charges to make, and I want to have much more information,” Mr. Tillerson said.', 'Mr. Rubio, saying there was plenty of public information — “the videos and pictures are there,” he noted — said that “it should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin’s military has conducted war crimes in Aleppo.”', 'Mr. Tillerson did not budge.', '“I find it discouraging, your inability to cite that,” Mr. Rubio said.', 'As the senator continued to cite the deaths of Mr. Putin’s opponents, Mr. Tillerson said he hoped to learn more once he could receive classified information on the matters.', '“None of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson,” Mr. Rubio shot back. “People are dead.”', 'Mr. Rubio, in his second round of questioning for Mr. Tillerson, pursued a similar tactic, asking Mr. Tillerson for his views on human rights violations in China and Saudi Arabia.', 'He asked Mr. Tillerson if he believed China was “one of the world’s worst human rights violators.”', 'Mr. Tillerson hedged. “They certainly have serious human rights violations,” he said.', 'When Mr. Tillerson equivocated on Saudi Arabia as well and Mr. Rubio appeared prepared to chastise him again, Mr. Tillerson suggested that the two were not as far apart as it seemed.', '“Our interests are not different, senator,” he said. “There seems to be some misunderstanding that somehow I see the world through a different lens. I do not.”', 'But Mr. Tillerson said he was “also cleareyed and realistic about dealing in cultures” that are unlike that of the United States.', 'Leaving the hearing after his third round of questioning, Mr. Rubio would not commit to supporting — or opposing — Mr. Tillerson, telling reporters that he was “prepared to do what’s right” even if fellow Republicans lined up behind Mr. Trump’s nominee.', 'Mr. Tillerson also told the committee that if he had been serving in office when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, he would have recommended that the United States provide arms and intelligence support to the government of Ukraine, and said the Obama administration’s reaction was viewed in Moscow “as a weak response.”', 'Mr. Tillerson’s prescription came in the opening two hours of his confirmation hearing, where he went out of his way to portray himself as a hard-liner in confronting Russia — an effort to defuse questions about his business relationships with Mr. Putin.', 'But in doing so, he put himself in direct opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump, who said in interviews with The New York Times last year that he doubted the utility of the sanctions the United States led against Russia.', 'As the questioning wore on, some senators nodded at the lengthy — and, at times, rocky — proceedings. “I’m glad you came back after lunch, Mr. Tillerson,” joked Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire.', 'She thanked Mr. Tillerson for outlining his efforts to disentangle himself from Exxon Mobil while seeking a role in government. But she added that his approach “stands in stark contrast to what we heard from President-elect Trump today” about his own business conflicts, referring to the news that Mr. Trump will not divest himself of his business empire.', 'Ms. Shaheen also asked Mr. Tillerson to weigh in on some of Mr. Trump’s most explosive campaign positions, like calls for a ban on Muslim immigration.', '“I think what’s important is that we are able to make a judgment about the people coming into the country,” he said. “I’m not supporting blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people.”', 'Pressed on Mr. Trump’s past calls for a national registry of Muslims, Mr. Tillerson said he “would need to have a lot more information around how such an approach would even be constructed.”', 'Mr. Tillerson appeared to break, at least somewhat, with a signature campaign position of Mr. Trump: his vocal opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.', 'Mr. Tillerson said he did not oppose the agreement, but added that he shared some of Mr. Trump’s concerns about whether the final version “serves all of America’s interests.”', 'Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, got to the key critique of Mr. Tillerson in an opening statement that challenged the nominee to explain what additional sanctions he would advocate against Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election and its activities in Syria.', '“Having a view from the C-Suite at Exxon is not at all the same as the view from the seventh floor of the Department of State,” Mr. Cardin said, referring to where the secretary’s office is. “And those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can, of course, run a government agency do a profound disservice to both.”', 'Mr. Cardin argued that “serving the narrow market-driven interests of Exxon shareholders is not the same as serving the national interests of all of the American people.” And he challenged Mr. Tillerson to indicate whether he “may ignore Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, his illegal annexation of Crimea and his intervention in Syria,” all of which President-elect Trump indicated, in an interview with The Times, were not high on his list of concerns.', 'Mr. Cardin added that he was “disappointed” that Mr. Tillerson’s prepared opening remarks included no mention of Russian hacking, adding that he also planned to press Mr. Tillerson on his prospective business conflicts.', 'Presented with Mr. Trump’s past suggestion that it might not be a bad thing if countries like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia acquired nuclear weapons, Mr. Tillerson replied, “I don’t think anyone advocates for more nuclear weapons on the planet.”', 'When Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, reminded him that Mr. Trump had in fact said this, Mr. Tillerson responded, “I do not agree.”', 'Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, broke with tradition by testifying against the nomination of a fellow senator, but said Mr. Sessions’s record left him no choice.', '“In the choice between standing with Senate norms or standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for my country, I will always choose conscience and country,” Mr. Booker said.', 'Mr. Booker issued a scathing rebuke of Mr. Sessions’ opposition to immigration and criminal justice reform, and laws protecting gays.', '“The next attorney general must bring hope and healing to the country,” he said, “and this demands a more courageous empathy than Senator Sessions’ record indicates.”', 'Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said Mr. Sessions’ mantra of “law and order” had a familiar, and negative, ring for African-Americans, particularly from the South.', '“Those who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Senator Sessions’ call for law and order will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then,” said Mr. Lewis, who protested segregation alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and was beaten severely during a march in Selma, Ala. “The rule of law was used to violate the human and civil rights of the poor, the dispossessed, people of color.”', 'The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, took a break from his chamber’s march toward passing the framework to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday to introduce his wife, Elaine Chao, and it was clear he was enjoying himself.', 'Praising Ms. Chao as “incredibly capable,” Mr. McConnell cheekily endorsed Mr. Trump’s pick for transportation secretary. “She’s got really great judgment, on a whole variety of things,” he said.', 'That tone continued during gentle questioning of Ms. Chao, with all indications pointing to an easy confirmation.']"

Trump Removes Stephen Bannon From National Security Council Post , Roll Call writes:,"['WASHINGTON — President Trump reshuffled his national security organization on Wednesday, removing his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, from a top policy-making committee and restoring senior military and intelligence officials who had been downgraded when he first came into office.', 'The shift was orchestrated by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was tapped as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser after the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, who stepped down in February after being caught misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador.', 'General McMaster inherited an organizational scheme for the National Security Council that stirred protests because of Mr. Bannon’s role. The original setup made Mr. Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, a member of the principals committee that typically includes cabinet-level officials like the vice president, secretary of state and defense secretary. The original order also made the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence only occasional participants as issues demanded.', 'Critics said Mr. Bannon’s presence in a national security policy-making structure risked politicizing foreign policy.', 'A new order issued by Mr. Trump, dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, removes Mr. Bannon from the principals committee, restores the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and intelligence director and also adds the energy secretary, C.I.A. director and United Nations ambassador.', 'A senior White House official presented the move as a logical evolution, not a setback for Mr. Bannon. He had originally been put on the principals committee to keep an eye on Mr. Flynn and to “de-operationalize” the National Security Council after the Obama administration, this official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. This official said that process had been completed.', 'Another official close to Mr. Bannon insisted the move was not in any way a sign that the president had lost confidence in him or wanted to reduce his portfolio. And as evidence he will still play a role in national security decisions, the aide said that Mr. Bannon still maintains the highest level of security clearance in the West Wing.', 'But the reorganization seemed a clear victory for General McMaster as he struggles to assert control over national security. In addition to the changing membership of the principals committee, the new order also puts the Homeland Security Council under General McMaster rather than making it a separate entity, as Mr. Trump’s original order had done.', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', 'General McMaster had envisioned making these changes shortly after taking the job in February, but proceeded slowly to avoid inflaming an already volatile situation. Mr. Bannon and his allies initially insisted his position would not change under any reorganization by General McMaster, but eventually the president was convinced that it was wiser to take him off the principals committee.', 'The principals committee, led by the national security adviser, is the primary policy-making body for national security, and decides questions that do not rise to the level of the president himself. The committee also debates issues that will get sent to the president, and frames the choices for him.', 'Political advisers traditionally have not served on the committee. President George W. Bush kept his senior adviser, Karl Rove, out of sensitive national security meetings. President Barack Obama permitted his senior adviser, David Axelrod, to sit in on some, but he was not given formal status and he has said he merely observed and did not participate.', 'In addition to giving Mr. Bannon formal membership, the original national security organization reduced the role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and national intelligence director, stipulating that they would attend only “where issues pertaining to their responsibilities are to be discussed.”', 'Members of Mr. Trump’s team said they did not mean to downgrade them; they simply took Mr. Bush’s original order and cut and pasted language into theirs, not realizing that the two officials had been upgraded under Mr. Obama.']"
Ab-Soul Breaks Down the Inspirations & Revelations Behind 'Do What Thou Wilt'," As he details his literary influences and discusses the importance of respect for history, hip-hop artist Alpha Beta Soul oozes ","['Ab-Soul is a thoughtful writer. Since bursting on the scene in 2009 as a member of TDE, the Carson, California, rapper has wowed audiences and critics with his layered songwriting and introspective nature. Now, he’s doing it with his latest album, Do What Thou Wilt.', 'Released Friday (Dec. 9) via Top Dawg Entertainment, the project is being billed as “a love story” by Soul, but that doesn’t mean it’s full of ballads. Instead, it’s an unconventional love tale that explores war, sexism, religion, drugs and family from a personal and global perspective.', 'On the eve of DWTW’s release, Soulo spoke with Billboard about its literary and true-life inspirations. He also opened up about why he’s calling rappers out by name, and why young MCs need to respect hip-hop history. Somehow, he does this all while staying true to the album’s overarching theme of love.', 'You’re an intricate writer, heavy on similes, metaphors and multiple meanings. When did your love for that style of writing start, and how do you cultivate that now?', 'It started from writing essays in school, incorporating metaphors and similes. When I picked up the pen to MC, Canibus was like the god at that time, a lyrical architect. Later on, you find Eminem, and you do your research and find Ras Kass and then all the real MCs come to play. You notice that they all have common themes and you see the poetry used, but they have their own distinctions and are telling their own tales. That’s where I string it in. I have all of these different templates, but I get to tell my testimony. That’s where it becomes Alpha Beta Soul.', 'The latest testimony is Do What Thou Wilt. Take me through this project from the idea to execution. What started it and what inspired it along the way?', 'Well, the album is based on [Aleister] Crowley’s The Book of the Law. That’s where the famous quote [from the title] is found. Doing research on Crowley, just being a scholar, I see his influence in music, culture, history, journalism [and so on] runs deep.', 'My theme [has been] “there’s nothing wrong with a righteous man.” I like to carry the cross, if you will. So you’ve got this guy that’s usually associated with cultists, satanists, and these types of things, but then you have this guy who idolizes Jesus as well. Another quote from the book that caught my interest was, “The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy.” With him obviously pushing the envelope to be the wickedest, most evil, most filthy, why not try to be the most righteous? With that comes so many themes. This album is also a love story and it’s also a woman-appreciation album as well.', 'You get into that appreciation on “Threatening Nature,” and women are a central theme throughout. What motivated that and what do you hope listeners take from it?', 'I cracked open The Book of Law and the first chapter is dedicated to the manifestation of Nuit, an Egyptian goddess. To me, the depictions of her represent the firmament. That stuck out to me, him having to manifest her first, I thought that was interesting.', 'Also in my studies, I found out what I mention in “Threatening Nature,” that the genealogy of Isis — the mother of the original Egyptian Holy Trinity — is Genesis abbreviated. Today, the most common Holy Trinity are the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with the woman removed. You also have the ISIS terrorist group, so you have kids who are gonna miss out on learning about Isis, the original mother of the holy trinity, but they’re gonna be immediately subjected to this terrorist group. I’m a mechanic, so I take all of these things into consideration, and that’s what this album is.', 'You bring up sexism on here, as well. Was that to shed light on something you felt was lacking?', 'Maybe it’s not because of a lack thereof. It’s just being aware of its lack thereof or not. Are we ready to have a female president? I think the world was ready to see that. I felt a lot of steam under Hillary [Clinton]. My girl’s daughter voted for her in school. She’s a kid and kids are doing things like that. So I felt the time of The Divine Feminine. Shoutout to Mac [Miller]. I feel that air. So that definitely supported me while I was coming up with [this project].', 'The album’s full of songs that are connected, like “God’s a Woman?” and “The Law,” the latter featuring Mac Miller and Rapsody. What was the concept that you wanted to convey with those cuts, and why were Mac and Rap perfect for it?', 'I’m glad you asked that. “The Law” is an actual conversation between Hadit and Nuit [from The Book of Law]. I’m playing the role of Hadit and I’m having a conversation with Nuit. That’s a classic Angie Stone sample [“Brotha”], and it was a tribute to the black man, a remarkable record. I wanted to do a tribute to the woman, not the black woman, but the woman. That’s why it was important for me to have Mac Miller sing along with me.', 'Rapsody and 9th Wonder actually just fell into the studio right on cue. I’m like, “Don’t rap. Just go in there and give them something from the spirit. Go in there and be a woman. Don’t just bar ‘em to death. Go in there and be a pretty young lady.” That’s what I tried to capture from [Rapsody] and she definitely executed.', 'Speaking of bars, the album starts with “Raw Backwards,” where you call rappers out by name. What inspired you to go to war with those MCs off the bat? You mention Jay Electronica and Troy Ave.', 'Let me start with Troy. Troy made a comment about Capital Steez that I did not like. Me and Joey [Bada$$] and the [Pro Era members], we’ve shared similar losses, if you can understand that, and those are really my little brothers. Certain things, I don’t feel should be said, man. That’s something I feel like I needed to address, and I hope that he doesn’t take it any other way but that. That was something that I feel like he should have just left out the argument. Let’s keep it hip-hop, let’s keep it competitive, but there’s certain boundaries. Let’s be responsible. [Steez’s] mom is still listening. His family is still listening and still watching. So, that was important for me to note.', 'We’re all familiar with Jay Electronica’s Periscope rant earlier this year and I’m the guard dog of the squad. I’m the rapper’s rapper. [At the time], Kendrick [Lamar] was in a position where he’d just had his Grammy nominations and a lot of positive things happening in his career where he didn’t need to respond. I didn’t feel like he even needed to say anything. I wanted to speak to him because I had the relationship with Jay Electronica anyway. That’s the black God to me, even to this day, and he knows that.', 'He put out a public apology too. Note that, but I said what I said for the same reason he said what he said. I know he respects that. It’s hip-hop and anybody can get it. Nobody’s exempt. We’re gonna keep that spirit alive with respect. Oh, and remember too, man, that all’s fair in love and war. Love is synonymous with war. Note that first and foremost, this is a love story, right off the bat. I think the greatest wars were fought over women, absolutely, and an OG will tell you gangbangin’ started over a woman.', 'Going back to the personal nature of the project, you talk about loving drugs on “D.R.U.G.S.,” and then on “God’s a Girl?” you say, “Top wants me to go to rehab.” What has your journey with drugs been like?', 'That line in particular, “Top wants me to go to rehab,” is about us becoming celebrities and being subject to much more, and us going out and him getting the he-said, she-said on his end about how we’re behaving, and making sure that we’re being responsible men first. [TDE CEO Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith is] a father figure first. He probably just heard a few conversations about me and might’ve felt that I might’ve needed some self-control, which is completely understandable.', 'We had a long talk and I’m honest. I’m an open book. That’s something where I wanted to start off like that and speak with him directly. I knew that would make him laugh. That’s the type of relationship we have as a company, as a team, so I’m able to do that. Another boss might’ve took that disrespectfully almost, so shoutout to him.', 'It’s also comforting to know that people want you to do well.', 'Yeah, it’s love first. [Speaking as Top Dawg]: “Self-control. Come on, we’ve got things to do. You’re supposed to be the smartest guy in the camp. What’s up?” That’s the vein that it came from and that’s love first. That’s a rare thing so I respect that.', 'Talking about drugs now, it was also interesting to me how drugs are usually referenced as girls and a lot of times, they’re female plants that we actually ingest. That was interesting to me, even down to heroine, meaning a goddess, a hero. Those connections alone are what made drugs such an interesting thing to discuss in the scheme [of the album].', 'Love is probably the most addictive drug. Then, you take into consideration the relationship between you and your mother. It’s unmatched and it’s probably what you’re gonna look for in your spouse. It doesn’t go away. I don’t care how old you are and even if she’s gone, you’re gonna consider your mother and what she would think. These things are going on today. It’s real outside. My mom is not wet behind the ears so I wanted to have a responsible conversation about these things in a way that even my mom can say, “Well put.” I can’t wait to have this convo, man. That’s gonna be the ultimate confirmation, seeing what mom has to say. Just hope I don’t get a whoopin’.', 'Speaking of respect, you often show respect to MCs who’ve come before you, whether it be Nas on “Stigmata” or Ras Kass on “Threatening Nature.” Recently you criticized Lil Uzi Vert for not wanting to rap on a DJ Premier beat. What duty do you think a young rapper has when it comes to research and history?', 'I feel like it’s important to know your grassroots in whatever field you choose to master. You want to know the origin of it, however outdated it may be to you. However outdated the first wheel might be to you, it became the tire. We have to remember that and we can’t denounce these things.', 'It’s a responsibility to me as I’m getting older too. I’m the big homie now, I’m almost 30. So it’s important to me as a big homie to keep challenging the fountain of youth so they can stay a fountain, so they can know their source, where they got their influence from. Uzi uses Auto-Tune. That’s Zapp & Roger. You gonna pass on Zapp & Roger beats too? [Laughs.]', 'I just feel like Uzi should’ve rapped on that Preemo beat so I’m telling Uzi to come holler at me. I’ll get Preemo on the line, and let’s cook up something. I know he can catch that tempo. He ain’t gonna tell me he can’t catch that tempo. Let’s get creative, man.', 'How did you do your research as a young Soulo?', 'You can’t undermine the fact that I grew up in a family-owned record shop, Magic Disc Music, rest in peace. My grandpa Cletus Anderson, who’s my biggest supporter right now, is also a founder of V.I.P. Records in the L.A. area. So, I had the resources to go back and get it all first-hand. I had access to go into the crates and the archives to find everything hands-on. It was cool because I got to see all of the references made. If you hear a rap song today, you don’t know that it was an original reggae sample from [the past]. Those types of things made it cool to me and I think that transpires to my threaded stye.', 'We talked about the lyrics for this project, but musically, what did you want to convey?', 'Musically, my biggest thing was the science, the mix, the engineering of it. Me and my guy [Derek] Ali always bumpin’ heads to make sure we come up with the best product we can. I was working with my man Josh Berg this time, who recorded a bulk of the project. Working between two engineers, files come up missing here and there and little mishaps, technical difficulties occurred, but it was a cool experience, making sure it was efficient and that all of my Picasso dots were in place.', 'Finally, even though you’re just releasing Do What Thou Wilt, I have to ask, what’s next? Have you already started working on a new project or are you focusing on this one for now?', 'What’s on my mind right now is how I’m gonna present this to the world live and in living color. That’s gotta be done. The visuals are coming out great and I’m very happy with that. Shoutouts to my guy Moosa [Tiffith], who helped me out a lot throughout this whole process. That’s Top’s son. And my man [Terrence] “Punch” [Henderson], of course, on the creative end. I just want to make sure that we deliver this live right now. That’s my main focus.']"
